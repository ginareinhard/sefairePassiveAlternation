# Introduction

The French construction *se faire* followed by an infinitive has evolved through analogy with the passive voice. Originally, it had a causative meaning, where the subject played an active role in the action. However, in some contexts, it can also be interpreted as passive, alternating with the *être* passive construction.

This study investigates the factors that influence the choice between *se faire* and *être* in the passive alternation in spoken French, with a particular focus on parliamentary debates. Specifically, we aim to understand what factors contribute to speakers’ preference for one construction over the other.

To address this question, we use a quantitative, multivariate, probabilistic approach to model corpus data. Our results show a main effect of semantic verb clusters, with communication verbs favouring *se faire* over *être* in passive constructions.

and the logistic regression model revealed a significant interaction between subject animacy and adversativity

# The French passive alternation of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}

This section introduces the French passive variants [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}, focusing on their structure and meaning in the context of passive alternation. While [être]{.smallcaps} is the standard passive construction in French, [se faire]{.smallcaps} can also function as a passive variant in certain contexts. We outline the factors used as predictors in our mixed-effects logistic regression model of the [être/se faire]{.smallcaps} alternation.

In this study, we use [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} in small caps to specifically refer to the passive variants and distinguish these forms from other uses of the verbs *être* and *se faire*.

## Canonical passive: [être]{.smallcaps} {#sec-etre}

### Structure and meaning

The passive in French inverts the syntactic functions of the arguments within a clause. The object of the active sentence, i.e. the undergoer, becomes the subject in the passive voice - a phenomenon known as diathesis. In French, the subject is typically encoded in the first position in a sentence. In the [être]{.smallcaps} passive construction, the undergoer is promoted to this position. This syntactic shift leads to topicalisation, shifting the focus away from the actor and onto the undergoer, emphasising the referent affected by the action and the action itself, rather than the referent performing it.

[être]{.smallcaps} consists of a form of the attributive verb *être* 'to be' and the *participe passif* (passive participle), which is identical in form to the *participe passé* (past participle), e.g. *élus* 'elected'. Although other attributive verbs, such as *rester* 'to stay' and *sembler* 'to seem', can also be used in passive constructions, they are less common. This term paper will focus specifically on the passive formed with *être*. In the [être]{.smallcaps} construction, the subject of the active sentence becomes an adjunct phrase, which is called *complément d'agent*, introduced by the preposition *par* or *de*. When the *complément d'agent* is present, the construction is referred to as *passif long*; when the agent is omitted, it is called *passif court* [@abeille2021grande: 210-211].

For example, in the following sentences from our sample from the French ParlaMint 2.1 corpus [@11356/1431], in 1.a the agent *nos concitoyens* appears in the *complément d'agent* introduced by *par*, while in 1.b the agent is omitted:

> (1) 
>
>     (a) *\[...\] ils sont élus par nos concitoyens au suffrage universel.*\
>         '\[...\] they are elected by our fellow citizens through universal suffrage.'
>     (b) *Les députés sont élus pour contrôler votre action.*\
>         'The members of parliament are elected to monitor your actions.'

The *passif long* can favour the interpretation of a habitual process, as in *La bière est servie par le patron* 'The beer is served by the owner'. In contrast, the *passif court* focuses on the action or its result, without specifying who performed it [@abeille2021grande: 219].

An impersonal passive (*passif impersonnel*) is also possible in French. In impersonal passives, the subject position is occupied by the expletive *il* 'it'. In this construction, the direct object can remain in the complement position [@abeille2021grande: 210-211]. An example of an impersonal passive from our sample is:

> 2.  *Il est prévu un suivi des progrès accomplis d'ici à fin juillet* *2018 \[...\]*\
>     'A follow-up of the progress made is planned by the end of July 2018 \[...\]'

Some grammars distinguish between a *passif verbal* (verbal passive), with an event interpretation, and *passif adjectival* (adjectival passive), with a resultative interpretation. According to *La grande grammaire du français* [@abeille2021grande], this distinction reflects semantic differences concerning the aspect of the event. With stative verbs, active and passive sentences are generally semantically equivalent, as seen in the examples *Tout le monde aime Marie* 'Everyone loves Marie' vs. *Marie est aimée de tout le monde* 'Marie is loved by everyone'. However, with event verbs, which involve a change in state or location, the passive form often emphasises the result or outcome of the change. For example, in the *passé composé* (compound past tense), *On a servi la bière* 'They served the beer' describes the event, while *La bière a été servie* 'The beer has been served' emphasises the result of the action [@abeille2021grande: 219].

Finally, distinguishing between passive constructions and adjectives in French is not always straightforward. One difference between them is that the *participe passif* can form impersonal constructions with a nominal complement, as seen in example 2. Additionally, adjectives often have antonyms with a negative prefix, such as *connu* 'known' and *inconnu* 'unknown'. In some cases, the adjective may have a meaning or construction that differs significantly from the passive participle, as in the contrast between *Ce restaurant est très couru* 'This restaurant is very popular' and \**On court beaucoup ce restaurant* [@abeille2021grande: 2012]

To summarise, [être]{.smallcaps} is the canonical form of passivisation in French, providing a means of shifting the focus from the actor to the undergoer, the action, and its result. The next section examines the passive variant [se faire]{.smallcaps}, which, while sharing some functional similarities with [être]{.smallcaps}, also presents distinct structural and semantic differences.

## [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive

```{=html}
<!--  Historical background

@bellec_grammaticalisation_2015 and @bellec_quand_2014 date the se faire + INF passive construction (PSF) to the middle of the 20th century and call it a "modern" construction that has since experienced a rapid increase in popularity. She describes a process of grammaticalisation and reanalysis for the PSF during/through which “se” has lost its reflexive meaning and “faire” has become an auxiliary. In merging, they form a “semi-auxiliary” and obtain a passive interpretation, while the causative meaning is lost (désémantisation). However, @bellec_construction_2014 claims that the causative reading did not disappear but instead coexists with the passive reading (debated, see below).

-   In contrast, @raineri_analyse_2010 [280-305] based on corpus data: sees origin much earlier, exists since origin of Middle French (14-17th century); NOT derived from causative reading, increased productivity from 19th century onward 
-   se faire passive "typologically marked", comparison to other Romance languages @koenig_semantic_1992 \[145\]; similar constructions exist in other Romance languages but passive reading only allowed in French @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 [236] -->
```

### Structure and meaning

When constructing a passive sentence, French speakers may choose to use [se faire]{.smallcaps} instead of the canonical [être]{.smallcaps}: The [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive construction, hereinafter called [se faire]{.smallcaps}, provides an alternative way to express passive meaning in French. [se faire]{.smallcaps} has been widely investigated and discussed, for example by @bellec_construction_2014, @gaatone_desagreable_1983, @koenig_semantic_1992, @kupferman_construction_1995, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013, @raineri_analyse_2010, @novakova_construction_2009, and @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987.

As example 3. shows, [se faire]{.smallcaps} consists of the pronoun *se* (which shows agreement with the subject), a form of the verb *faire* ('to do'), and a verb in the infinitive. In 4. the construction is used with intransitive verbs. Its semanatics are then composed of the literal meaning of its components; it does not have a passive sense:

> 3.  *Des policiers se font agresser.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     'Police officers are attacked.'
>
> 4.  *Elle se faire rire.* [@kupferman_construction_1995: 61]\
>     'She made herself laugh.'

[se faire]{.smallcaps} resembles [être]{.smallcaps} in that the direct object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. This subject is the experiencer of the action described. Different than with [être]{.smallcaps}, however, the diathesis is not restricted to the direct object: [se faire]{.smallcaps} has "greater syntactic flexibility" [@raineri_analyse_2010: 93-95] and can also occur with ditransitive verbs, where the indirect object becomes the subject, as demonstrated by the following example 5.

> 5.  *Les intéressés peuvent se faire expliquer tout ce qui touche aux retraites.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     'Interested parties can have everything related to pensions explained to them.'

[se faire]{.smallcaps} can also be used to express active involvement of the subject while still conveying a sense of subject undergoing.

> 6.  *Oh... tu t'es fait couper les cheveux pour l' été!* [@raineri_analyse_2010: 156]\
>     'Oh.. you've had you hair cut for summer!'

However, constructions like 6. are controversial: Sveberg [-@sveberg_se_2012: 164-165] argues that such instances of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are fundamentally causative rather than passive, since the subject both initiates and undergoes the action (as in: 'You've made the hairdresser cut your hair').

Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 235] classifies [se faire]{.smallcaps} as “formally causative, but semantically passive”. The semantic tension between the fundamentally causative nature of the verb *faire* and the passive reading has led scholars to question the nature of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, as Koenig and Pederson [-@koenig_semantic_1992: 145] put it: "how can a passive-like construction arise from a combination of a causative and a reflexive marker, where no marking of the passive function is apparent?". Various answers to this question have been proposed: @kupferman_construction_1995 sees the causative and passive readings as homonyms with fundamentally different semantics. According to him, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is always causative when used with an intransitive verb (ex. 5.), but always passive when used with "non-agentive" predicates [@kupferman_construction_1995: 61]. This is in line with Bellec [-@bellec_construction_2014; -@bellec_quand_2014], who takes a diachronic approach: She describes a process of grammaticalisation and reanalysis for [se faire]{.smallcaps} through which *se* has lost its reflexive meaning and *faire* has become an auxiliary. According to her, the causative meaning has not disappeared but now coexists with the passive reading. Notably, Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 280-305]'s corpus study suggests that the [se faire]{.smallcaps} did not derive from the causative reading but evolved independently.

Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 23] adopts a syntactic approach, proposing that the passive meaning is derived through a mechanism that links the empty NP-object position of the embedded verb to the subject via *se*. This binding causes the subject to be interpreted as affected, as it is coindexed with the missing object, which would be affected in the active sentence, but is absent on the surface in [se faire]{.smallcaps}. This interpretation works only when the embedded verb has an agentive subject, as the missing object must be affected. The subject therefore remains the agent of the action, but is at the same time affected by the action of the embedded verb, which creates the passive interpretation.

These accounts offer only a brief glimpse into the complex analysis of [se faire]{.smallcaps}. How does the passive reading emerge, and how does it differ from the syntactically identical causative reading? These questions remain controversial, and will be explored in the following @sec-debate.

### Passive vs. causative: the debated passive status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} {#sec-debate}

The above-described stance taken by @bellec_construction_2014, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013, @koenig_semantic_1992 and @kupferman_construction_1995 that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a full-fledged passive construction and clearly separate from the causative is by no means undisputed. The opposing view - that the construction is a type of causative - is also widely represented in the literature. It is most prominently presented by @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 and has more recently been reworked by @sveberg_se_2012. In their view, the passive of [se faire]{.smallcaps} emerges only from the context, not from the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction itself. They centre their argumentation around the notion that the subject of [se faire]{.smallcaps} "is always, even unconsciously, responsible for the occurrence of the embedded event."

However, Koenig [-@koenig_semantic_1992: 143] points out that sentences including [se faire]{.smallcaps} can have both a passive and a causative sense. We find examples of this in the ParlaMint corpus, one of which is provided in 7.:

> 7.  *\[...\] il y a \[…\] des parlementaires qui **se sont fait élire** sur la promesse de ne pas supprimer 120 000 postes.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     '\[...\] there are \[…\] Members of Parliament who **were elected** on the promise not to cut 120,000 jobs.'\
>     '\[...\] there are \[…\] Members of Parliament who **made themselves be elected** on the promise not to cut 120,000 jobs.'

As Washio [-@washio_when_1993: 45] describes, the linguistic proximity of causativity and passivity is not exclusive for French but quite typical across the world's languages, as "passive and causative senses are shown to share a basic conceptual structure". Crucially, passive and causative [se faire]{.smallcaps} are structurally identical, differing only in their semantics. According to Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 236] the ambiguity is resolved by the semantic nature of the three main components: subject referent, *se* and *faire*. Referring to these three components, Bellec [-@bellec_construction_2014: 207] defines the following criteria to distinguish the causative from the passive interpretation:

1.  In the causative, the subject referent is agentive and has the role of both causer and patient. The subject actively initiates what happens to them. In the passive, the subject referent has only the role of the patient and is affected by the event.
2.  In the causative reading, the particle *se* has a reflexive meaning whereas in the passive reading, *se* is not reflexive.
3.  In the causative reading, *faire* has transparent causative meaning. This causative meaning is lost in the passive reading, where *faire* has no inherent meaning. <!-- add: how will we distinguish them / have we distinguished them in our study -->

Sometimes both readings are possible and the ambiguity cannot be resolved [@koenig_semantic_1992: 144], especially with cognition and perception verbs [@bellec_construction_2014: 206-207]. Therefore, despite its productivity as a passive construction, Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 356-357] concludes that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is problematic because it does not fit into two distinct categories nor does it function as a single weak causative. She points to the possibility of multiple readings [@kokutani_sur_2005] or continuum between causative and passive [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 89, 154-166].

<!-- In the causative reading, "se" is understood as reflexive and "faire" as causative. In contrast, in the causative reading, if interpreted as a passive, the meanings of "se" and "faire" are not transparent. Thus, the subject referent does not necessarily cause the event and is not necessarily responsible (@koenig_semantic_1992\[143\]: "any notion of causation is absent"). -->

This debate has been central to the investigation of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and cannot be left aside. However, even if the status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} has been the subject of disagreement and discussion, the literature clearly shows that there is a passive reading associated with this construction. This is independent of whether the passive sense emerges from within the construction or from the components it occurs with, or whether it has an underlying causative meaning. By comparing [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} constructions, and examining the factors contributing to the choice of one or the other, we aim to shed light on this debate from a corpuslinguistic perspective. <!-- (-> exclude causative readings?). Can our findings contribute to the debate of whether se faire deserves passive-status? If not: no need to spell out the debate in detail. -->

## [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}: competition or complementation? {#sec-factors}

### Defining the variable context {#sec-sefaire-context}

Both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} passives are available for the active diathesis [@novakova_construction_2009: 108] and assign the role of the undergoer to the subject referent. Therefore, the two variants form an alternation and are expected to compete with each other in contexts where passive is expressed. We find that both variants may be used in the same context:

> 8.  *Je remarque d' ailleurs que ce sont souvent ceux qui filment qui **se font éborgner** ou **sont blessés** par des tirs de LBD*. (ParlaMint)\
>     'Incidentally, I've noticed that it's often those filming who **get their eyes poked out** or **are injured** by LBD fire.'

However, some scholars speak of semantic differences between the canonical être passive and [se faire]{.smallcaps}: As Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 108] notes, the constructions differ in semantic nuances, as they have *un sens proche mais pas identique* ('a similar but not identical sense'). These differences may be more or less pronounced depending on the context: According to Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 87], [se faire]{.smallcaps} is marked and predominantly used in informal contexts. Additionally, [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a strongly figurative sense that [être]{.smallcaps} is missing: It is often used as part of idiomatic or lexicalised expressions [@raineri_analyse_2010: 165; @novakova_construction_2009: 117], and is associated with a *besoin d’expressivité and extravagance* ('a need of expressivity and extravagance') [@bellec_construction_2014: 206]. As discussed in @sec-debate, previous research also suggests that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is more likely to have a causative undertone while [être]{.smallcaps} is more neutral, with varying degrees of passivity for [se faire]{.smallcaps} [@raineri_analyse_2010: 154-166].

These subtle differences in meaning pose certain challenges for the contrastive analysis of the alternation. Bohmann et al. [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 35-36] face similar obstacles when defining the variable context of the English passive alternation of [be]{.smallcaps} and [get]{.smallcaps}. Since our aim is to investigate constructions that participate in the passive alternation of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}, we follow Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 165] in including only [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions that have a natural paraphrase with [être]{.smallcaps}. In line with Bohmann [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 35] who claim that "all extracted forms should be genuine instances of the variable under investigation" and that "only cases where both variants can be used interchangeably should be considered", we intend to exclude non-contrastive constructions, such as idioms and ditransitive verbs. Our criteria for excluding constructions are explained in detail in @sec-filtering-criteria.

We recognize this "fuzzy" [@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 50] variable context as both a challenge and an opportunity: It is precisely these subtle differences that make the analysis interesting and our research valuable. Consequently, our study seeks to identify the exact factors influencing the choice between the two variants by statistically modeling real language data. Our central research question is: What factors determine the [se faire]{.smallcaps}: [être]{.smallcaps} passive alternation in spoken French, specifically in parliamentary debates? In other words: what factors influence speakers’ choice between these two constructions? In the following sections, we outline the factors we anticipate will shape this choice and present our hypotheses of passive preference.

<!-- être: exclude adjectives and some participles that do not form the passive (similar to @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [36])/ "instances that allow for gradation" @hundt_be-_2024 [92];; Maybe better in Borderline cases/ filtering criteria) -->

```{=html}
<!-- Several corpus studies on voice choice in French have shown that the choice between active and passive constructions (*être* passive) is not purely syntactic, but that semantic and pragmatic factors also play a crucial role in determining whether a passive construction is favoured.

-   Subjects in passive sentences are preferably animate, definite, and pronominal. In the study by @da_cunha_lalternance_2020, animate, definite, and pronominal arguments that function as the objects in active sentences were more frequently found in the passive (and vice versa). -\> prominence / informational structure as significant factor. (And: constituent length, shorter constituents are preferred in subject position and favour the passive voice) -->
```

### Subject responsibility {#sec-subj-resp}

As indicated in @sec-debate, the question whether the referent of the subject in the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction holds any responsibility is central to the debate of the construction's passive-status [@sveberg_se_2012, @bellec_construction_2014: 212-213]. In line with their argument that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a kind of causative, @gaatone_desagreable_1983 and @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 state that the subject referent of [se faire]{.smallcaps} is always a causer and therefore always responsible to some degree. They contrast it to [être]{.smallcaps}'s subject referent, which is seen as more neutral. Gaatone [-@gaatone_desagreable_1983: 164] distinguishes between an "active patient" in [se faire]{.smallcaps} and a "passive patient" in [être]{.smallcaps} [@raineri_analyse_2010: 96].

In contrast, Kupferman [-@kupferman_construction_1995: 59] gives [se faire]{.smallcaps} examples where the subject cannot possibly be interpreted as responsible, one of which is repeated in 9.:

> 9.  *Elle sanglotait parce que son tout jeune bébé venait de se faire enlever les amygdales.* [@kupferman_construction_1995: 59]\
>     'She sobbed because her little baby got operated on for tonsilitis.'

In 9., *son tout jeune bébé* 'her little baby' does not have any responsbility for the action happening to them. The sentence can only be interpreted as passive. According to Kupferman [@kupferman_construction_1995: 98-99], subject responsibility emerges from the context and not from inherently passive [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Further support for this idea comes from @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 and @washio_when_1993. For @martin_construction_2002, subject dynamism, but not subject intentionality, is a necessary condition [@raineri_analyse_2010: 90].

Thus, although the requirement of subject responsibility in [se faire]{.smallcaps} is not "universally accepted" [@raineri_analyse_2010: 98], the analyses show some consensus in that [se faire]{.smallcaps} prefers to mark the subject as connected to the event [@raineri_analyse_2010], either through affectedness, responsibility or intentionality. We expect that this tendency is less pronounced for [être]{.smallcaps}. In our study, we model subject responsibility by the factors subject animacy, subject gender, complément d'agent, and modal verbs. Our overarching hypothesis is that [se faire]{.smallcaps} will be favoured over [être]{.smallcaps} in constructions with responsible subjects, indicated by animate, masculine subjects, the absence of complément d'agents and the presence of modal verbs.

**Subject Animacy**

Corpus studies have shown that animacy significantly influences voice choice in French. A human undergoer (i.e. the direct object in the active voice and the subject in the passive) increases the likelihood of using [être]{.smallcaps} over the active voice in written as well as in spoken French [@da_cunha_lalternance_2020; @da2022alternance]. According to @da_cunha_lalternance_2020 and @da2022alternance, this is due to animate referents being more salient than inanimate ones, which makes them more likely to be promoted to subject position. In parallel, we also expect the animacy factor to play an important role in the distribution of [se faire]{.smallcaps} in relation to subject responsibility.

As discussed in the debate on subject responsibility, subjects of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are typically active participants in the described action. Since inanimate subjects are rarely affected, and even less often responsible, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is predominantly used with animate subjects. While Gaatone [-@gaatone_desagreable_1983: 166-167] argues that [se faire]{.smallcaps} requires animate subjects, there are counterexamples in the literature [@labelle_anticausativizing_2013; @kokutani_sur_2005; @novakova_construction_2009: 111; @sveberg_se_2012]. However, these appear to be exceptions. Both corpus data [@novakova_construction_2009: 111] and experimental evidence [@koenig_semantic_1992: 151, 153] point to a strong correlation between subject animacy and the use of [se faire]{.smallcaps}. In Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 111]'s corpus study, fewer than 3% of [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions had inanimate subjects. This is also supported by a survey by @koenig_semantic_1992, where French native speakers rated [se faire]{.smallcaps} with animate subjects as significantly more acceptable than with inanimate subjects. As Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 92] puts it, the preference for animate subjects with [se faire]{.smallcaps} is one of the few aspects on which scholars agree [@raineri_analyse_2010: 92].

The preference for animate subjects with [se faire]{.smallcaps} finds a parallel in the English [get]{.smallcaps} [@hundt_be-_2024], which also tends to occur with animate subjects. There is evidence that [get]{.smallcaps} has become more common with inanimate subjects over time [@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 43], which may indicate a shift away from subject responsibility. Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 92] suggests that a similar change may be occuring in French, with [se faire]{.smallcaps} potentially becoming less constrained in terms of subject animacy. However, Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 92] notes that [get]{.smallcaps} allows for inanimate subjects more frequently than [se faire]{.smallcaps}.

Animacy is considered a hierarchical scale in the literature, most prominently by @zaenen_animacy_2004. However, for the scope of our study, we define animacy as a binary factor (inanimate/animate). Following @zaenen_animacy_2004, we classify metonymic references to organisations, understood as "collectivities of humans", as animate. In line with the literature, we hypothesise that animate subjects favour [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}. However, we expect that both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} are more frequent with animate subjects than with inanimate subjects. Additionally, we propose that passive choice may not be determined by animacy alone, but rather by its interaction with the semantic verb cluster. We describe this interaction hypothesis in the discussion of verb clusters in @sec-aspectuality.

**Gender**

Since previous research suggests that grammatical gender plays a role in voice choice, it is worth investigating whether this effect extends to the alternation between [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}.

@da_cunha_lalternance_2020 found that in written French, a feminine agent argument increased the likelihood of [être]{.smallcaps} over the active voice in their *passif court* model - i.e. where the agent is omitted - with no interaction with animacy (human/non-human) or definiteness. This suggests that grammatical gender itself may directly influence voice choice. However, given the study’s small sample size, it is also possible that an interaction effect exists but was not statistically significant. @da2022objectifying observed a similar syntactic bias in both French and English, where female referents were less likely to appear as subjects than male referents. In French, they found an interaction between the grammatical gender and animacy, as the bias was only evident for human referents.

Since we do not infer the actor from context in this study, our analysis focuses solely on the gender of the subject in the passive construction. If [se faire]{.smallcaps} favours subjects with high salience, responsibility, or affectedness, the grammatical gender of the subject may influence the alternation between [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps}. Specifically, if feminine referents are perceived as less active or agentive in certain contexts, a feminine subject may favour [être]{.smallcaps} over [se faire]{.smallcaps}.

To test this, we categorise gender into four levels: unknown, mixed, masculine, and feminine. Our hypothesis is that a feminine subject will favour [être]{.smallcaps} and disfavour [se faire]{.smallcaps}. We will test the potential interaction between gender and animacy, as the effect of grammatical gender may depend on whether the subject is animate or inanimate, potentially linking to the social gender of animate subject referents. Additionally, we will examine how unknown or mixed-gender subjects behave in terms of this alternation.

**Complément d'agent**

The *complément d'agent* introduces an external argument into the passive construction, typically referring to the causer or instigator of the action that is the driving force behind the event described. It is derived through diathesis from the subject of the corresponding active sentence (@sec-etre).

The *complément d'agent* is optional. It is usually formed with *par*, sometimes also with *de*, and even more rarely with *dans*. We do not consider the special case with *dans* in our analysis. In most cases, *de* alternates with *par*. The choice between *par* and *de* is not always interchangeable in meaning. For arguments introduced by *par* @kupferman_construction_1995 **(pages?)** postulates an "agentivity requirement", attributing strong responsibility to them. In contrast, *de* is generally associated with non-dynamic, static, or non-agentive interpretations. For instance, with the verb accompagner, a *complément d’agent* with par implies a more active role of the argument than with *de*. Some verbs, such as *constituer*, naturally prefer *de*. Passive constructions with *de* frequently occur with state verbs, which belong to different semantic classes. Additionally, verbs where the subject is an infinitive or a subordinate clause occur with de in the passive voice. With a nominal subject, the passive with *de* is a remnant of Classical French and is therefore very rare, affecting only 2% of cases [@abeille2021grande 216-218].

We are aware that introducing the *complément d'agent* as a predictor in our analysis introduces an additional source of variance. However, we have chosen to include it, as we believe it plays a crucial role in subject responsibility. Corpus studies on English passive constructions by @hundt_be-_2024 and @bohmann_large-scale_2023 suggest that the agentive prepositional phrase (*by*-phrase) reduces subject responsibility by introducing another entity that carries the agentive role. We believe the same may hold for French, where the *complément d'agent* could similarly influence the distribution of passive constructions.

We hypothesise that the *complément d'agent* influences the choice between *se faire* and *être* passives. The presence of a *complément d'agent* should favour *être* passives, as it introduces a responsible external argument and shifts responsibility away from the subject. In contrast, the absence of a *complément d'agent* is expected to favour *se faire* passives, which imply some degree of subject responsibility. **We expect phrases with de to have an even stronger effect than phrases with par, as they typically refer to less agentive or abstract sources, contradicting the dynamic nature of the se faire passive construction, which typically occurs with adversative or strongly agentive actions. To examine this, we will test the interaction between the complément d'agent and the verb cluster??, as we expect the se faire passive to be favoured by dynamic (and adversative) verbs (see \@seq-XXX).**

**Modal verbs**

Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 116-117] notes that modal verbs frequently occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. According to Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 97, 162] one possible reason is that modals contribute to subject involvement by expressing agentivity. Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 97] presents @martin_construction_2002 's observation [^1] that volitional verbs fit well with [se faire]{.smallcaps} because they involve an intentional action that results in a change of mental state. Since modals usually convey some kind of subject intention or involvement, we expect [se faire]{.smallcaps} to appear more often with modal verbs than [être]{.smallcaps}.

[^1]: Unfortunately, we could not get access to the original paper of @martin_construction_2002 and therefore need to rely on @raineri_analyse_2010's report.

We mark a sentence as modal if a form of one of the modals *devoir*, *vouloir* or *pouvoir* has scope on [se faire]{.smallcaps}. We limit the modal category to these three modal verbs to ensure consitent annotation; verbs that could have a modal sense in some contexts (e.g. *savoir*) and paraphrasal constructions indicating subject responsibility (e.g. *avoir besoin de, arriver à, réussir à, envier de, avoir des difficultés pour, avoir la possibilité de, avoir envie de*) are not assigned modal status.

### Adversativity

The factor of adversativity is reflected in the semantics of the verb and captures the negative consequences of the described action for the subject. This factor has been shown to influence the choice between the English [be]{.smallcaps} and [get]{.smallcaps} passives [@chappell1980get; @hundt_be-_2024: 89, 96-97; @bohmann_large-scale_2023], with [get]{.smallcaps} being realised more often with adversative verbs than [be]{.smallcaps}. Since @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 and @raineri_analyse_2010 draw paralles between the [get]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive, we see an adversativity effect for [se faire]{.smallcaps} as likely.

@gaatone_desagreable_1983 argues that [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a strong *sens désagreable* ('unpleasant sense'), as it occurs mainly with verbs that have a negative connotation. Although Kupferman [-@kupferman_construction_1995: 77] rejects this unpleasantness as a characteristic of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, he agrees that it is more commonly used in negative contexts than [être]{.smallcaps}. This is supported by corpus data: Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 110] found a clear preference for [se faire]{.smallcaps} to be realised with negative actions, with 30% of verbs in [se faire]{.smallcaps} denoting unpleasant events, and only 5% denoting pleasant events. <!-- Also: @raineri_analyse_2010 [247].-->

As @bohmann_large-scale_2023 note in their investigation of the [be]{.smallcaps}/[get]{.smallcaps} alternation, two hypotheses relate to verb sentiment: the adversativity hypothesis and the non-neutrality hypothesis. Both suggest that [get]{.smallcaps} favours verbs with negative connotations, but only the non-neutrality hypothesis also predicts [get]{.smallcaps} to correlate positively with positive sentiment. Since verbs with positive sentiment have been shown to be rare with [se faire]{.smallcaps} [@novakova_construction_2009: 110], we have chosen not to test them. In their corpus study on the [be]{.smallcaps}/[get]{.smallcaps} alternation, @hundt_be-_2024 categorise this factor as binary - "adversative" versus "non-adversative/neutral". For practicality and clear statistical modelling, we adopt this approach, tagging verbs as "adversative" if the event negatively affects the subject, and "non-adversative" if the event is neutral or positive. In line with the previous findings, we hypothesise that [se faire]{.smallcaps} will be preferred over [être]{.smallcaps} for verbs that denote unpleasant actions (i.e. those labeled as "adversative").

According to Gaatone [-@gaatone_desagreable_1983: 170], the concept of adversativity conflicts with subject responsibility in [se faire]{.smallcaps} because subjects would not willingly bring negative events upon themselves. He argues that unpleasant actions expressed with [se faire]{.smallcaps} typically have a purely passive interpretation, whereas pleasant actions tend to be initiated by the subject, resulting in a causative reading. This contrast suggests an interaction between adversativity and subject animacy that reflects the subject's affectedness. Adversative events could be perceived differently depending on the animacy of the subject, with animate subjects being more likely to be perceived as negatively affected than inanimate subjects. Consequently, adversative verbs could favour [se faire]{.smallcaps} more strongly with animate subjects than with inanimate ones.

### Aspectuality {#sec-aspectuality}

Regarding the factor of aspectuality, @keenan_passive_2007 [340] propose that "If a language has two or more basic passives they are likely to differ semantically with respect to the aspect ranges they cover." If we assume that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a "basic passive", this suggests that [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} have different aspectual preferences. Aspectuality is expressed through the verb, either via inherent lexical semantics ("Aktionsart") or grammatical marking (TAM: tense, aspect, mood) [^2] [@kortmann_triad_1991 : 13]. Overall, we predict a preponderance of [se faire]{.smallcaps} for hitting-touching verbs and progressive aspect. <!-- We do not examine mood in this study.-->

[^2]: The general consensus in the literature is that aspect marks progressivity grammatically and Aktionsart marks it semantically/ lexically. However, this clear distinction between aspect and Aktionart has been doubted, and some theories see Aktionsart und Aspect as two instantiations of Aspectuality [@Dik+1997+217+246: 221].

**Semantic verb clusters**

[se faire]{.smallcaps} tends to occur with dynamic processes, particularly in contexts where the source role is agentive and the target role is affected, which is the typical case of semantic transitivity [@raineri_analyse_2010 90, 238]. Several hypotheses in the literature attempt to explain the compatibility of certain verbs with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. For example, @kupferman_construction_1995 \[67\] and @raineri_analyse_2010 [90] argue that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is compatible with dynamic verbs but not with state verbs or verbs of state change with an external "cause" argument. (However, exceptions to this pattern are noted by Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 110], @martin_construction_2002 **pages?** and @raineri_analyse_2010 [100-103].)

@martin_construction_2002 [14] challenges the notion that an external source always implies agency. She argues that a source can induce a change of state without intentionality and should therefore be classified as an "effector" rather than an agent. To support this claim, she contrasts two examples:

1.  

    a.  \**Je me suis fait étrangler par mon écharpe.\
        *'I was strangled by my scarf.'

    b.  *Isadora Duncan s'est fait étrangler par son écharpe qui s'est prise dans l'essieu de sa voiture.\
        *'Isadora Duncan was strangled by her scarf, which got caught in the axle of her car.'

While the first sentence is ungrammatical, the second is more acceptable, suggesting that the role of the source does not necessarily imply agency. @martin_construction_2002 also argues that [se faire]{.smallcaps} with psychological verbs, such as in *Elle s'est fait séduire par Pierre* 'She was seduced by Pierre', is not always causative but can have a passive reading. Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 110] also notes that, while rare, [se faire]{.smallcaps} can sometimes be interpreted passively with state verbs, as in *Il peine encore à se faire aimer par tous les siens* 'He still struggles to be loved by all his own'.

The semantic class of the verb has been shown to play a crucial role in the use of the passive voice in oral French [@da2022alternance] and in the alternation between [be]{.smallcaps} and [get]{.smallcaps} passives in English [@bohmann_large-scale_2023]. In the corpus study by @da2022alternance, **85%** of verbs in the *frapper* class ("hitting-touching" verbs describing violent actions) occurred in the passive voice, while only **15%** were used in the active voice. This aligns with findings from journalistic English, where verbs describing violent actions are frequently used in the passive voice [@henley1995syntax] **and Bohmann?**. According to @da2022alternance, this preference can be explained by two factors: (1) the topical character of the undergoer affected by a hitting-touching action, which makes it more likely to be promoted to subject position, and (2) the ability to omit an unknown or less salient agent, which relates with the concept of subject responsibility. We expect this effect to hold for [se faire]{.smallcaps} as well. Even though both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} topicalise the undergoer, [se faire]{.smallcaps} typically implies some degree of subject involvement. Consequently, highly dynamic verbs such as *frapper* might increase the likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}, where the subject is a more passive patient.

As shown in @fig-clusters, some verb clusters in the study by @da2022alternance did not show a strong preference for passive constructions, with active and passive forms appearing in approximately equal proportions (e.g. verbs of perception, cognition, psychological states, behaviour, movement and transfer). However, locative and communication verbs were more frequently used in the active voice. While this preference was not statistically significant for locative verbs, communication verbs showed a significantly higher tendency towards active constructions.

![**Frequency** of active and passive constructions for the verb clusters](images/clusters_dacunha-abeillé.png){#fig-clusters fig-align="center" width="470"}

@da2022alternance suggest that this pattern can be explained by the verbal disposition hypothesis by @stallings1998phrasal, according to which verbs show a preference for specific syntactic constructions that speakers store in their mental lexicon. communication verbs frequently occur with object complements, which rarely function as subjects. Since the active voice allows these verbs to maintain the object complement, they naturally favour active constructions over passive ones. @thuilier2012lemme makes a similar argument regarding communication verbs and postverbal complements. Additionally, communication verbs often feature an animate or human actor, which is more likely to be encoded as the subject in active constructions [@da2022alternance].

Hitting-touching verbs are dynamic and adversative, making them more likely to appear in passive constructions. Since these verbs emphasise the subject’s affectedness, they may be particularly compatible with [se faire,]{.smallcaps} where the subject typically is an affected undergoer. In contrast, with communication verbs, the subject is not necessarily affected in the same way. While the subject is involved in the communication event, it does not imply a significant change or affectivity, possibly making [se faire]{.smallcaps} less compatible with these verbs. communication verbs tend to favour the active voice due to their syntactic properties, particularly their frequent use of object complements. Additionally, as they typically feature a salient animate or human subject in the corresponding active construction, they may be less likely to occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. We therefore hypothesise that hitting-touching verbs favour [se faire,]{.smallcaps} while communication verbs favour [être]{.smallcaps}. We expect all other classes to not have a preference for either passive variant and group them together as "neutral". These include psychological, behavioral, movement, and transfer verbs. Their distribution between [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} may depend on additional contextual factors.

To test this hypothesis, we categorized the verbs according to their lexical class. Following @da2022alternance we used the verb cluster categories from the online version of the lexicon "Les Verbes Français" [@lvf], based on the work by @dubois1997verbes. @tbl-clusters in the appendix presents the French verb clusters defined by @francois_presentation_2007, on which this dictionary is based, along with language examples from our dataset. If there was no exact match, we used the closest similar class. In one case, *caillasser*, there was no entry in the lexicon: here we classified it as a hitting-touching verb, given its similarity to verbs like *attaquer*, *frapper*, or *bombarder*.

However, the effect of the verb cluster may interact with other factors, particularly animacy and adversativity. We also tested the interactions with these factors. We expect the animacy of the subject to have a stronger effect if the verb is from the "hitting-touching" or the "neutral" category. [se faire]{.smallcaps} could be strongly favoured with animate subjects compared to inanimate subjects, while this effect could be weaker with communication verbs, which could favour [être]{.smallcaps} regardless of animacy. The adversativity of the verb could favour [se faire]{.smallcaps} more in communication and neutral verbs than in hitting-touching verbs. While communication verbs may favour [être]{.smallcaps} and neutral verbs may not have a strong preference, adversative constructions may shift both toward [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Since hitting-touching verbs are inherently highly adversative, this factor is unlikely to strongly affect their passive preference.

**TAM**

The tense and aspect markings French cannot be clearly distinguished from each other because they heavily influence each other and depend on each other.

According to @raineri_analyse_2010 \[365\], the "type of process denoted by the verb" is a "necessary condition". inchoative/ durative aspect: "get passive and se faire passive focus on onset of the process that affects the subject referent, whereas be and être passive present the process in its entirety, without offering an internal perspective." ? According to @bellec_construction_2014 [209], the *être* passive is likely to describe a result or mark an endpoint of an action, while the *se faire* passive is used for actions in progress and verbs that are in their nature ongoing (e.g. perception verbs, @bellec_construction_2014 [209])

Tense, aspect, and mood are not entirely separable categories but are functionally interdependent. Tense can serve as an indicator of aspect in terms of how it sets the temporal focus of a sentence. Constructions in the passé composé tend to focus on the completed event, which could increase the likelihood of the *être* passive over the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive. In contrast, the imparfait, which emphasises the ongoing process, might favour the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive. In the present tense, we expect both passives to be evenly distributed, as the present tense emphasises neither the end point nor the process. Descriptions of future events tend to emphasise the beginning and ongoing process of an action rather than its end point (@bellec_construction_2014 [210]). We therefore expect that in the future tense, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is favoured over the *être* passive.

According to @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 [141] and Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 115, periphrases that denote progressivity, such as *être en train de* + INF, *venir de* + INF and *aller* + INF, occur more naturally with the *se faire* passive than with the *être* passive. This is because the *se faire* passive conveys a dynamic, ongoing action (Quelle) compared to the more stative *être* passive. (also: @bellec_construction_2014; @keenan_passive_2007 [341], @raineri_analyse_2010 [91]

We decide against coding tense, aspect and mood as separate factors, but consider them in the context of a functional category that reflects the difference between process focus (progressive) and result focus (non-progressive). Therefore, we establish a TAM-category with two levels: progressive and non-progressive. The descision to not keep the categories separately is based on findings by @bellec_construction_2014 \[210\] who argues that aspectuality and tense are closely intertwined and together are responsible for whether a sentence is understood to be progressive or non-progressive. This marking reflects the more functional nature of category distinction in French rather than the formal distinction in English for example. And even in English: @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [39]: "Form of auxiliary verb: present, preterite, perfect, infinitive, -ing" OR progressive/non-progressive) -\> only effect found by @bohmann_large-scale_2023 \[49\] that present and preterite disfavour get passive. @hundt_be-_2024 [97] does tag tense and aspect separately but later, in the interpretation, interpret them together in terms of a tam category (result: se faire favours progressive but non-significant effect).

(sentence for conditional marking: Subjonctif and conditional forms excluded because of CQL? Or: We mark them according to the tense they occur with)

Movement verbs also frequently occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps}, as noted by @raineri_analyse_2010 [90], who highlights the verbs *aller* and *venir* as examples. These verbs emphasize the initial phase of the process (*Spang-Hanssen 1967: 143*). Additionally, perception verbs, which imply a durative process, are also attested in *se faire* constructions [@novakova_construction_2009: 117].

**levels**:

-   "progressive": imparfait, futur, periphrase constructions (called "progressive" but includes tense)

-   "non-progressive": passé composé, plus-que-parfait, present tense without periphrase construction

! & "**se faisant remplacer" -\> progressive form**

Progressive category: emphasises ongoing or continuous actions, includes the imparfait, futur (except for futur antérieur - "I will have..."), and periphrastic constructions like *être en train de* + INF, *venir de* + INF or *aller* + INF.

Non-progressive category: completed actions, includes the passé composé, plus-que-parfait, and the present tense without progressive constructions.

Our hypothesis is that progressive marking (whether through tense or periphrasis) favours the *se faire* passive, while non-progressive marking (e.g., passé composé, plus-que-parfait) favours the *être* passive.

# Data and methods {#sec-data-and-methods}

Prior to conducting our study, we preregistered its protocol on the platform [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org) [@AsPredictedWharton] to enhance transparency and accountability [@huensch2024preregistration]. The preregistered study can be accessed [here](https://aspredicted.org/gp6y-dd8p.pdf).

To maintain anonymity while ensuring transparency and consistency, we refer to ourselves as Annotator A and Annotator B when describing the manual steps.

## Data collection {#sec-data-collection}

### Corpus {#sec-corpus}

In our investigation of spoken French language, we aimed to select a corpus that authentically reflects natural language use. After careful consideration of available resources, we chose the French ParlaMint corpus version 2.1 [@11356/1431]. Although our preregistration document refers to version 2.0, this was a typographical error. Version 2.1 was the intended and only version available on [SketchEngine](http://www.sketchengine.eu) [@kilgarriff2014sketch] at the time of data collection. As such, this does not represent a deviation from our planned methodology.

ParlaMint comprises French parliamentary debates from 2017 to 2020 and contains 38,702,395 tokens (32,214,147 words). We selected this corpus not only for its size and accessibility but also because it is well-documented, POS-tagged, and contains detailed metadata. We specifically chose a spoken-language corpus because [se faire]{.smallcaps} is known to occur more frequently in speech than in writing [@raineri_analyse_2010: 105].

The genre of parliamentary debates is somewhat specialised and our results may not fully generalise to all French spoken language. However, it still offers a wide topical range and a high level of linguistic diversity. It has also been the subject of previous linguistic research [e.g. @skubic2022networks]. As such, the ParlaMint corpus provides a valuable and representative cross-section of contemporary spoken French.

### Semi-automated approach {#sec-semi-automatic-approach}

To extract our sample, we used a semi-automatic approach combining CQL expression-based extraction and manual filtering. Our aim was to obtain an equal number of occurrences of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions.

First, we used a CQL expression to automatically extract a sample of 1,254 [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions from the French ParlaMint corpus [@11356/1431]. After this, Annotator A manually filtered the data to exclude false-positives, i.e. constructions that did not meet our predefined criteria for [se faire]{.smallcaps} passives (see @sec-filtering-criteria). During the filtering process, Annotator A also annotated the lemmas of the constructions and compiled a list. After filtering, the final sample consisted of 535 valid [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions.

```{r lemma-list, include=FALSE}

lemmas <- sefaire_sample |> 
  count(lemma)

```

Next, we extracted the [être]{.smallcaps} constructions using a CQL expression in SketchEngine. To filter the concordances, we used the list of lemmas derived from the [se faire]{.smallcaps} sample, ensuring comparability between the two construction types by controlling for verb-specific differences that might influence the results. Due to SketchEngine’s download limit, we retrieved the [être]{.smallcaps} constructions in four subsamples, each containing between 9,295 and 9,794 concordances. After downloading, all filtered instances were stored in a .csv file and merged into a single dataframe in `R`. To ensure reproducibility, we set a random seed using the function `set.seed()`, with the seed value derived from the lottery numbers on Wednesday, 12th March 2025, as listed on the official [Lotto website](https://www.lotto.de/lotto-6aus49/lottozahlen). The last digit had to be removed to match the required length. We then randomly sampled a subset of concordance lines that was equal in size to the manually filtered [se faire]{.smallcaps} sample (i.e., 535 instances**, reduced to 532)**.

### Manual filtering exclusion criteria and borderline cases {#sec-filtering-criteria}

For our study of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} as a passive alternation, our main criterion was to include only those [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions that have a passive (and not an exclusively causative) reading, i.e. constructions that could be paraphrased with [être]{.smallcaps}. Consequently, we excluded expressions that could not be rephrased with [être]{.smallcaps}, either because the [être]{.smallcaps} construction was ungrammatical or the meaning was fundamentally altered.

We defined the following additional criteria, which follow from our main criterion:

-   **Transitivity of the verb**: the verb is a transitive verb (the direct object of the active sentence is the subject of the passive sentence). As described in @sec-etre, [être]{.smallcaps} requires a direct object in the active equivalent which becomes the subject in the passive voice. For reflexive and ditransitive verbs, [être]{.smallcaps} is not available and does not compete with [se faire]{.smallcaps}, which is why we excluded such constructions from our analysis. Additionally, we excluded impersonal passive constructions (*passif impersonnel*) due to the lack of a subject referent.

-   **Exclusion of fixed idiomatic expressions**: the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction is not a fixed idiomatic expression with a figurative meaning. We speficically excluded constructions classified as "idiomes lexicalisés" (lexicalized idioms) according to @raineri_analyse_2010\[163\]. These constructions neither carry a true causative nor passive meaning[^3] and cannot occur with a complément d'agent: *se faire entendre*, *se faire sentir*, *se faire attendre*, and *se faire désirer* [@raineri_analyse_2010: 163]. Examples of additional fixed idiomatic expressions that we filtered out include: *se faire passer pour* 'to impersonate sb.', *se faire avoir* 'to be fooled', *se faire mousser* 'to boast/brag', *se faire taper sur les doigts* 'to get a slap on the fingers, to be scolded'.

-   **Exclusion of adjectival constructions**: we excluded [être]{.smallcaps} constructions that are essentially adjectival constructions, such as *elle est connue* 'she is known'. Accordingly, [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions that would typically be rephrased with an adjectival [être]{.smallcaps} construction were also excluded.

[^3]: These verbs mainly occur with inanimate subjects (effects, consequences, discontent). @raineri_analyse_2010 [163-164] proposes that the causative meaning is not available for these verbs since the subject is not causing the event. There is also no passive meaning since they cannot cannot occur with a complément d’agent and do not have a paraphrase with être.

To ensure consistency and practicality, we decided to include or exclude verbs based on their lemma, rather than on individual occurrences. After manually evaluating all occurrences, the following lemmas were excluded from our sample: *entendre*, *sentir*, *ressentir*, *attendre*, *désirer*, *voir*, *connaître*, *passer (pour)*, *mousser*, *avoir*, *rouler (se faire rouler dans la farine)*, *mener (se faire mener par le bout du nez)*.

We also excluded imperative constructions because of their rarity in the passive and because of the semantic contradiction. While the passive focuses on the undergoer of an action, the imperative demands the performance of an action. We anticipated that imperatives would be unevenly distributed, potentially leading to statistical distortions.

Regarding tense, we chose to include all tenses in our analysis, including the present tense, based on previous literature suggesting that the present tense favours [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps} (see @sec-aspectuality). Tense is an important feature in our study, as part of the TAM factor. This approach contrasts with @da_cunha_lalternance_2020 and @da2022alternance, who focused exclusively on passive constructions in the compound past tense (*NP a été VP*) to prioritise verbal passives over adjectival passives, such as *La porte est ouverte* 'The door is open'. By including all tenses, we ensured that we did not exclude too many [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions and obtained a sufficient number of occurences for the analysis. This decision was therefore motivated both by the aim to capture the overall syntactic range of the passive alternation and by the importance of tense within the TAM factor. While we recognise that this approach increases complexity, we believe that it allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the [être]{.smallcaps}/[se faire]{.smallcaps} alternation.

A typical example of a [se faire]{.smallcaps} construcion that met our criteria is:

> (1) *Les élus se font très souvent insulter \[...\]\
>     *'The elected officials are often insulted \[...\]'

The corresponding [être]{.smallcaps} paraphrase would be:

> (1) *Les élus sont très souvent insultés.\
>     *'The elected officials are often insulted.'

In contrast, expressions such as *se faire connaître* were excluded. For example:

> (1) *Cette baisse est ensuite une conséquence de la crise économique de 2018 dont les effets se font connaître aujourd'hui.\
>     *'This decline is then a consequence of the 2018 economic crisis, the effects of which are becoming known today.'

When paraphrased with [être]{.smallcaps}, *connus* takes on an adjectival function:

> (1) *Cette baisse est ensuite une conséquence de la crise économique de 2018 dont les effets sont connus aujourd'hui.*\
>     'This decline is then a consequence of the 2018 economic crisis, the effects of which are known today.'

While we excluded purely causative constructions, the distinction between causative and passive constructions was not always clear. The question arose: when is a construction semantically close enough to a passive alternation, and when does its meaning lean too much toward a causative interpretation? As expected, given the ongoing debate about the passive status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} (see @sec-debate) and the difficulties noted by Bohmann et al. [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023] in their study of the English [be]{.smallcaps}:[get]{.smallcaps} passive alternation, we encountered a number of “unclear” cases during the manual filtering of constructions. We acknowledge that, similar to their study, there is no straightforward distinction between causative and passive readings, and some degree of subjectivity in categorization is unavoidable.

This approach is also supported by linguistic analyses that suggest a continuum between causative and passive meanings in constructions with *se faire* (see @sec-sefaire-context). The constructions may shift between passive and causative interpretations depending on the surrounding context. Their inherent flexibility suggests that a strict binary classification is inadequate, reinforcing the idea of a passive–causative continuum. This continuum can be understood in terms of the degree of agentivity of the subject referent. When its role is reduced to mere initiation of the event, the construction can be fully paraphrased with [être]{.smallcaps} without altering the overall meaning of the sentence. For example, *Il se fait remarquer par une patrouille de police* 'He is noticed by a police patrol' and *Il est remarqué par une patrouille de police* 'He is noticed by a police patrol' show an extensive equivalence between [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps}. Moreover, other elements in the co-text can weaken the causative strength and strengthen the passive effect, reflecting variable agentivity depending on the specific discourse context\[ @raineri_analyse_2010 154-160\].

We identified numerous cases where a clear binary distinction between passive and causative was not possible, for example when the subject is both the undergoer and the causer of the action. In general, we opted for a broad approach, including as many constructions as possible. This means that even when the causative reading appeared more natural (because the subject initiates the event), we included the construction as long as a passive understanding was also plausible (since the subject also undergoes the action). In doing so, we deviate from the more restrictive first criterion proposed by @bellec_construction_2014. Representative examples of such constructions in our sample include *se faire vacciner* 'to be/get vaccinated', *se faire élire* 'to be/get elected' or 'to stand for election', *se faire remarquer* 'to be/get noticed' or 'to draw attention to oneself'.

### Inter-rater agreement

In preparation for statistical modelling, we annotated the filtered sample for the features outlined in @sec-factors. A blind annotation process was used, where Annotator A and Annotator B were unaware of each other’s annotations. As [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} data were collected separately, some steps were necessary before conducting analyses on the data. First, the data was cleaned by aligning the speaker and reference columns. Since annotator A annotated all complément d' agents of [se faire]{.smallcaps} during initial filtering, the column `agent_pp` was renamed to `agent_pp_A`. The datasets were then combined, variables were converted from characters to factors and empty values were replaced with `NA` to ensure proper handling of missing values in statistical analysis.

```{r read-annotated-data, include = FALSE}
sefaire_sample_annotated <- read.csv(file = here("data", "sefaire_sample_annotated.csv"))
etre_sample_annotated <- read.csv(file = here("data", "etre_sample_annotated.csv"))
```

```{r data-cleaning-colnames, include = FALSE}

```

```{r data-cleaning-colnames-2, echo = FALSE}

Since the analysis required detailed (and time consuming) manual annotation, we decided to split the annotation work between us. However, to ensure consistent annotation, a representative sample of one third of all instances (320; 33,25%) were double-annotated, i.e. by both of us. For these instances, we calculated Cohen's ϰ (Kappa) as a measure of inter-rater agreement, following Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 201].

```{r cohens-kappa, include = FALSE}

We classified the ϰ-values using the influential benchmark categorisation of Landis and Koch [-@landis1977measurement: 165], who define an agreement of 0.81 - 1.00 as "Almost Perfect". Mean inter-rater agreement is high at `r  mean_kappa`. Agreement is lowest for the cateogories adversativity (0.67) and TAM (0.77).

### Data preprocessing {#sec-data-preprocessing}

For the main analysis, the combined data of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} data were merged into one data set where each column corresponds to one factor. The columns indicating a factor include the annotations of the first annotator (annotator A for half of the observations, annotator B for the other half).

```{r merge-to-main-dataset}
#| code-fold: true
#goal: one dataset with one column for each factor, the column includes the annotation of the "main" annotator
# special case agent pp column: if passive variant is se faire -> take value from column "agent pp_A", if passive variant is être is: same procedure as with the other variables
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_combined |> 
  mutate(
    subj_animacy = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ subj_animacy_A,
                             annotator == "B" ~ subj_animacy_B),
    subj_gender = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ subj_gender_A,
                            annotator == "B" ~subj_gender_B),
    agent_pp = case_when(passive_variant == "se faire" ~ agent_pp_A,
                         passive_variant == "être" ~ case_when(
                           annotator == "A" ~ agent_pp_A,
                           annotator == "B" ~ agent_pp_B)),
    modal = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ modal_A,
                      annotator == "B" ~ modal_B),
    tam = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ tam_A, 
                    annotator == "B" ~ tam_B),
    cluster = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ cluster_A, 
                        annotator == "B" ~ cluster_B),
    adversativity = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ adversativity_A, 
                               annotator == "B" ~ adversativity_B)
  )

# remove now-redundant A and B columns, remove ID (irrelevant since it's only there for être)
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean |> 
  dplyr::select(-subj_animacy_A, -subj_animacy_B, -subj_gender_A, -subj_gender_B, -agent_pp_A, -agent_pp_B, -modal_A, -modal_B, -tam_A, -tam_B, -cluster_A, -cluster_B, -adversativity_A, -adversativity_B, -ID)
```

The sample comprised 1064 observations, 532 for [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} each. We looked at the data distribution among the categories and levels to identify scarce combinations and patterns that could be problematic for analysis.

```{r first-look-main-data, include = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_gender)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$agent_pp)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$modal)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$tam)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$cluster)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$adversativity)
```

We observed certain patterns in the distribution of passive constructions across the levels of each factor: The subject animacy level 'inanimate' has comparatively few occurrences with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. The subject gender level 'mixed' appears infrequently overall and was excluded to avoid distorting the analysis and to ensure interpretability.

The subject gender level 'unknown' appears much more often for [se faire]{.smallcaps} than for [être]{.smallcaps}. We suspect that this may be an annotation-related effect: When annotating gender, we took grammatical gender marking into account. Since [être]{.smallcaps} is realised with a participle that always agrees in gender with the subject, gender was always identifiable, and only impersonal constructions were annotated as 'unknown'. In contrast, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is very common in infinitive constructions, which do not indicate gender. Therefore, when gender was not inferable from the context, it was labelled 'unknown'. We suspect that this created an artifact, as 'unknown' is strongly correlated with infinitive constructions, and thus with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. To test this, we created two separate data sets, one with 'unknown' and one without, which will be compared in the analysis. The data set without 'unknown' contained 503 [être]{.smallcaps} and 367 [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions.

The complément d'agent level 'de' is also relatively rare with [se faire,]{.smallcaps} but we decided to keep it for interpretative reasons. However, we flagged it as a potential problem and kept the option open to exclude it later, if it proved to have a negative impact on the analysis.

```{r cleaning-main-data, include=FALSE}
# exclude "mixed" gender because of low frequency (would likely skew the data)
#sample with "unknown" kept
passive_sample_unknown <- passive_sample_clean|>
  filter(subj_gender != "mixed") |>
  droplevels()

# exclude "unknown" gender (needs to be reasoned and explained!)
# (merge "de" and "par" into a "present category")
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean|> 
  filter(subj_gender != "mixed") |> 
  filter(subj_gender != "unknown") |>
  droplevels()

# passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean |> 
#   mutate(agent_pp = case_when( #to merge par and de
#     agent_pp %in% c("par", "de") ~ "present",
#     TRUE ~ agent_pp
#   )) |> 
#   mutate(agent_pp = factor(agent_pp))

#check levels
levels(passive_sample_clean$subj_gender)
levels(passive_sample_unknown$subj_gender)

#check passive distribution without unknown
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant)

```

## Binomial logistic regression

In addition to conducting a descriptive analysis of the data, we employed a binomial logistic regression model to test our hypotheses. This method provides a logit value for each variable that "represents the chances of construction A to be chosen in a particular type of context compared with the chances of construction B to be used in the same type of context" [@levshina_how_2015: 253]. The model allowed us to exactly track the influence of factors and their interactions on the chances of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used over [être]{.smallcaps}.

### Levels {#sec-levels}

The levels are ordered alphabetically by default. We rearranged the reference levels to be most useful for both modelling and interpreting: Where possible, we chose the most standard case as a reference level (passive variant: être; complément d' agent: 0; modal: no; TAM: non-progressive, cluster: neutral). If this would negatively affect the stability of the model, the most frequent (subject animacy: animate, subject gender: masculine) or the most evenly distributed case (adversativity: adversative).

| Factors | Label | Levels |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Passive variant | passive_variant | être, se faire |
| Subject animacy | subj_animacy | animate, inanimate |
| Subject gender | subj_gender | masculine, feminine |
| Complément d'agent | agent_pp | 0, de, par |
| Modal | modal | no, yes |
| TAM | tam | non-progressive, progressive |
| Cluster | cluster | neutral, communication, hitting-touching |
| Adversativity | adversativity | adversative, non-adversative |

passive_sample_unknown$subj_gender <- relevel(passive_sample_unknown$subj_gender, ref = "masculine")

```

### Model selection

We fit a mixed-effects binomial logistic regression model in `R` following Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 253-276] and Gries [-@gries_statistics_2021: 393-452]. The model estimates the log of the odds that a given construction is realized with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. To account for individual variation, we included the verb `lemma` and the `speaker` (as indicated in the meta data of ParlaMint 2.1) as random effects.

We set a significance threshold p-value of 0.05 and applied backward stepwise selection [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Model quality was monitored and compared using the Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC), with preference given to the model with the lower AIC value [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Non-significant factors were removed one-by-one, starting with the one with the highest non-significant p-value [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Additionally, we evaluated model fit using R^2^, aiming to find the model with the highest possible value and therefore explains most of the variance. Note, however, that Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015] raises concern about the meaningfulness of R^2^ in logistic regression.

::: panel-tabset
#### Maximal model

First, we constructed a model that included all the factors described in @sec-levels, the interactions we hypothesised to be significant, and the random effects of speaker and lemma. While the model did not include all theoretically possible interactions, we considered it maximal in the sense that it encompassed all factors and interactions identified in the literature review as potentially meaningful and contributing to passive choice.

`passive_variant ~ subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:gender + subj_animacy:cluster + subj_animacy:adversativity + cluster: adversativity + (1|lemma) + 1|speaker)`

Although the main effect of `subj_gender` could not be interpeted due to its participation in an interaction, it is striking that the odds ratio of `subj_gender[unknown]` is very high with a huge confidence interval of 10.49 – 124.99. The AIC is 771.3 with an R^2^ of 0.599 when excluding random effects and 0.748 when accounting for them. The vif-analysis revealed no high collinearity values for `subj_gender` or the interaction `subj_animacy:subj_gender`. However, as explained in @sec-data-preprocessing, we suspected an annotated-related artifact related to the level `unknown`. For that reason, we decided to compare the model to one fitted on the data set that excludes `unknown` constructions.

```{r max-model-unknown, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
final_model_unknown <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:subj_gender + subj_animacy:cluster + subj_animacy:adversativity + cluster:adversativity) + (1|speaker) + (1 | lemma),
    family = "binomial", 
    data = passive_sample_unknown,
    control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
  )

summary(final_model_unknown) # AIC: 759.3
```

```{r max-model-unknown-tab, echo = FALSE}
tab_model(final_model_unknown, show.aic = TRUE) # Marginal R2 / Conditional R2	0.701 / NA

#### Model without `unknown`

After excluding `unknown`, the model's AIC improved to 732.5. The model has an R^2^ of 0.46 / 0.67. Although this is lower than the model without `unknown`, and therefore explains less variance, overall, the model seems to make better (i.e. more stable and more precise) predictions. Since the variance explained by the random effects is larger than zero, the random effects had to be kept. Due to its better performance, the data without `unknown` were used in future models.

```{r full-passive-glmer, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
full_passive_glmer <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:subj_gender + subj_animacy:cluster + subj_animacy:adversativity + cluster:adversativity) +

vif(full_passive_glmer)
```

tab_model(full_passive_glmer, show.aic = TRUE)
```

#### Model without non-significant interactions

All non-significant interactions (`cluster:adversativity`, `subj_animacy:cluster`, `subj_animacy:subj_gender`) were removed, improving the AIC to 725.4 with an R^2^ of 0.450 / 0.664. Thus, without the interactions, model accuracy increased while the explained variance decreased slightly. With $p$-values \> 0.05, the categories `subj_gender`, `agent_pp`, `modal` and `tam` were found to be non-significant.

```{r model-back-1, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
model_back_1 <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:adversativity) + (1 | lemma) + (1 | speaker),

  )

summary(model_back_1) #AIC: 725.4
```

```{r model-back-1-tab, echo = FALSE}
tab_model(model_back_1, show.aic = TRUE)
```

#### Final model

Non-significant fixed effects were removed step by step, starting with `tam`, which has the highest $p$-value. At each step, the main effect with the highest $p$-value was eliminated. The final model is reported here. Although `subj_gender` remained non-significant ($p$ \> 0.05), we retained it for theoretical and interpretative reasons. The AIC of 719.2 indicates that removing `agent_pp`, `modal` and `tam` improved the model quality while R^2^ stayed constant at 0.451 / 0.662.

<!-- After encountering singularity issues during the bootstrap validation of the stability and uncertainty of the coefficients (see @sec-model-diagnostics), we decided to remove the random effect of the speaker due to a lack of variance, which contributed to the model's instability. -->

### Model diagnostics {#sec-model-diagnostics}

**Residuals**

To check goodness of fit and usability of the final model, we examined the residuals visually. Gelman and Hill [-@Gelman_Hill_2006: 97] state that due to to the discreteness of data in logistic regression, "plots of raw residuals from logistic regression are generally not useful". Instead, they recommend plotting binned residuals. Following this suggestion, we checked the residuals of the model using the `binnedplot()` function from the `arm` package, which sorts residuals into categories, so called "bins". By default, the number of bins equals the rounded squareroot of the total amount of data points (for our model: `floor(sqrt(848)) == 29`). <!-- Elen: residual patterns are important but they don't prove that the model is correct/ incorrect/ unusable; once residual effect is significant -> look at the magnitude; p-values are among other things dependent on the sample size (data size); indicates that model may not be the best fit and that some of the inferential measures may not be reliable BUT no model is perfect -->

```{r residuals-diagnostics-binned, echo = FALSE}
# residuals: actual - predicted values
predictions <- predict(final_model, type = "response", na.action = na.omit)
binnedplot(predictions, residuals(final_model, type = "response"))
```

At first glance, the residuals appear to be quite random with no obvious patterns and with most residuals around 0. The grey lines mark the bounds of the standard error; ideally, these bounds should emcompass 95% of the binned residuals [@Gelman_Hill_2006: 97]. Although the SE bounds essentially capture the shape of the residuals and the majority of the residuals fall within them, a considerable proportion fall outside the desired area: 11 out of 29 (`r paste0(round(11/29, 2) * 100, "%")`), which is well above the desired 5%.

In this context, a slight pattern emerges: Negative deviations are more common for low to medium expected values (i.e. low predicted probability of [se faire]{.smallcaps}), while positive deviations occur more often for high expected values (high predicted probability of [se faire]{.smallcaps}). In the mid-range (0.3-0.7), where [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} are predicted to be about equally likely, the binned residuals are exclusively negative (`y < 0`). Thus, when the correct level was [être]{.smallcaps}, the model often predicted a higher probability of [se faire]{.smallcaps}. This pattern is reversed for predicted probabilities of `x > 0.7`: All deviations are positive (`y > 0`), indicating that when [se faire]{.smallcaps} was the correct variant, the model slightly underestimated the probabilities of [se faire]{.smallcaps} occurring and could have been even more confident. In addition, there is one extremely negative bin between `x = 0.4` and `x = 0.5`, indicating that the model drastically overestimated [se faire]{.smallcaps} in this range. Except for this one bin, the residuals in the mid-range are close to 0 and within SE limits.

```{r outlier-bin, include=FALSE}
outlier_bin <- subset(passive_sample_clean, predictions >= 0.4 & predictions < 0.5)
summary(outlier_bin)
table(outlier_bin$passive_variant, outlier_bin$subj_animacy, outlier_bin$adversativity)
```

<!-- Looking at the data from this bin, it is striking that it contains more occurrences of the rather atypical (compared to se faire) combination of être + animate subject [+ adversative] than se faire (but only 6), since the combination of subject animacy and strongly predicts se faire -> the model is likely to make incorrect predictions for all these cases, predicting se faire and incorrectly classifying être passives as se faire? overgeneralisations for animacy and adversativity? > This suggests that the model overestimates the predictive power of animacy and generalises too much from the frequent co-occurrence of se faire and animate subjects, misclassifying atypical être+animate cases.-->

To investigate these potentially problematic characteristics further and determine whether these indicate systematic errors of the model, we conducted additional residuals tests. Following the recommendations of Gries [-@gries_statistics_2021: 445], we used functions from the `DHARMa` package to gain more detailed insight into the residuals structure: <!-- If p-value is > 0.05, the "null hypothesis of normality cannot be rejected" [@levshina_how_2015: 162] -->

<!-- Another thing that catches the eye is the accumulation of points around x= 0 y = 0 that have a diagonally falling pattern and fall just outside the SE bounds. For these, a low probability of [se faire]{.smallcaps} was correctly predicted. -->

```{=html}
<!-- negative residuals for x\<0.5: model is confident that the correct level is être and with that, it is correct but estimated the probability of se faire to be too high

-   positive residuals for x\>0.5: model is confident that the correct level is se faire and is correct but underestimated probability of se faire (could have been even more confident) -->
```

```{r residuals-diagnostics-DHARMa-dispersion, echo = FALSE}
#install.packages("DHARMa")
sim_res <- simulateResiduals(final_model)
testDispersion(sim_res)
#plot(sim_res)
# testOutliers(sim_res)
#testQuantiles(sim_res)
```

The `DHARMa` dispersion plot shows that the residuals are approximately normally distributed, the dispersion test indicates no evidence of over- or underdispersion (dispersion = 0.97, $p$ = 0.632), suggesting that the variance of the residuals is consistent with model expectations. The outlier test is negative, showing no significant deviations from the expected distribution.

```{r residuals-diagnostics-DHARMa-qq, echo = FALSE}
#install.packages("DHARMa")
testUniformity(sim_res)
#testQuantiles(sim_res)
```

The QQ-Plot reveals a significant deviation ($p$ = 0.02965) as tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which may point to unreliable inferential measures. However, $p$-values depend (among other factors) on sample size and the KS test is reportedly highly sensitive to minor deviations **(reference),** many of which naturally occur in large data sets such as ours. Based on the overall distribution of residuals, we assess the magnitude of this deviation to be minor. <!-- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html -->

Overall, we did not interpret the `DHARMa` plots as evidence of poor model performance. The most 'worrying' result of the residual tests were therefore the non-optimal binned residuals that revealed the model's overoptimism that a construction is [se faire]{.smallcaps} when it is actually [être]{.smallcaps}. On the other hand, the model is not optimistic enough for very high probabilities of [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Taking all residual diagnostics together, we understand them to indicate a stable model structure that makes reliable predictions, but we acknowledge that the model is by no means perfect and could be further improved.

**Concordance index**

As Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 256] describes, the concordance index measures the ability of the model to discriminate correctly by providing the proportion of times when the model predicts the use of the variant correctly.

```{r concordance-index, echo = FALSE}
# outcome <- as.numeric((passive_sample_clean)$passive_variant) - 1

outcome <- as.numeric(na.omit(passive_sample_clean)$passive_variant) - 1

concordance_final_model <- Hmisc::somers2(predictions, outcome)["C"]
```

The model has a high concordance index of `r   round(concordance_final_model, 2)`. According to the scale reported in Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 259], this indicates "outstanding discrimination".

**Significance**

Additonally, we apply an overall significance test by comparing it to a model without predictors (i.e. null model) using an ANOVA [@gries_statistics_2021: 445-446].

```{r model2-significance, include = FALSE}
null_model <- glmer(passive_variant ~ 1 + (1 | lemma) + (1 | speaker), data = passive_sample_clean, family = binomial)

# null_model <- glmer(passive_variant ~ 1 + (1 | lemma), data = passive_sample_clean, family = binomial)

anova_final_model <- anova(final_model, null_model, test="Chisq")

#highly significant!
# ### model with unknown
# null_model <- glmer(passive_variant ~ 1 + (1|lemma), data = passive_sample_without_unknown, family = binomial)
# 
# anova(final_model_without_unknown, null_model, test="Chisq")
# #highly significant!!
# #relative likelihood
# (exp((AIC(null_model)-AIC(final_model_without_unknown))/2))
```

```{r anova-tab, include = FALSE}
kbl(anova_final_model)
 #relative likelihood
(exp((AIC(null_model)-AIC(final_model))/2))

rel_likelihood <- exp((AIC(null_model) - AIC(final_model)) / 2)

# ANOVA to data frame
anova_df <- as.data.frame(anova_final_model)
anova_final_model

# p-value
anova_df$`Pr(>Chisq)` <- format(anova_df$`Pr(>Chisq)`, scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)

# add relative likelihood
anova_df$`Relative Likelihood` <- c(NA, rel_likelihood)
```

```{r anova-kable-tab, echo = FALSE}
# kable table
kbl(anova_df, format = "html", digits = 3) |> 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed", "responsive")) |> 
  row_spec(2, bold = TRUE)
```

The ANOVA shows that our model is highly significant (LR-test=181.02, $p$ \<0.0001), indicating a strong improvement over the null model. The model has a vastly higher relative likelihood compared to the null model.

**Coefficients**

Looking at the log odds of the significant variables, it becomes apparent that communication verbs boost the chance of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used, while [être]{.smallcaps} is more likely in non-adversative contexts with inanimate subjects. (Although non-significant, feminine subjects are more likely to occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps} than masculine subjects.)

```{r coefficients-log-odds, echo = FALSE}
final_model_coef <- coefficients(summary(final_model))[,"Estimate"]
#"a negative coefficient expressed as a logit (or log odds) shows that this outcome is less probably than the reference level", positive -> more likely than reference level
kbl(final_model_coef)
```

We convert the coeffients to odds ratios for better interpretability.

```{r coefficients-odds, include=FALSE}
#convert from log odds to odds:
exp(final_model_coef)

#convert odds to probabilities
#exp(model_2_coef) / (1 + exp(model_2_coef))
```

The intercept of the final model is 2.76. This means that in the context of the reference levels (subject is animate and masculine, the cluster of the verb is neutral and the construction has an adversative sense), the chances of [se faire]{.smallcpas} being chosen are 2.76 times greater than [être]{.smallcaps}. The exact values of odds ratios are interpreted with regard to our hypotheses in @sec-results.

**Bootstrap Validation**

We used bootstrapping to validate the stability of our model's coefficients. This method involves random resampling with replacement from the original dataset, analysing each resample, and comparing the resulting estimates to the original. It allows for internal model validation without the need for new external test data [@levshina_how_2015: 166].

We used the `bootMer()` function from the `lme4` package to perform bootstrapping on our mixed-effects model, resampling 1000 times with the same random seed that we used during data sampling for reproducibility. When running `bootMer()` to validate the stability of the fixed effects in our model, we encountered singularity warnings in most of the bootstrap iterations. Convergence during bootstrapping was achieved only when the `bobyqa` optimiser was used. Although `isSingular()` returned `FALSE` for the final model, the instability across resamples indicates limited reliability. Removing the `speaker` effect resolved the singularity issues. This suggests that there may be too little variance between speakers to reliably estimate this random effect. However, removing `speaker` also increases the model’s AIC from 719.2 to 732.0, indicating a poorer overall fit. Additionally, excluding the random effect would change the model’s structure and require re-specification and re-evaluation, which exceeds the scope of this term paper. For interpretation, we therefore rely on our original model, while acknowledging its limitations in terms of robustness. We consider the simplified model without `speaker` (see @fig-model-without-speaker) a potentially more stable alternative, which could be explored more in depth in future work.

```{r bootstrap-validation, include = FALSE}

#bootstrap_final_model <- bootMer(
# final_model,

Final Model without the `speaker` Random Effect
:::

@tbl-bootstrap-summary shows the summary of the bootstrap statistics for our final model. As noted by Gries [-@gries_statistics_2021: 385], models often perform better on the data they were trained on because they capture patterns that may not generalise beyond the sample, which is called overfitting. According to Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 167], large differences between training and test performance, referred to as optimism, can indicate overfitting. In the summary of our bootstrap statistics in @tbl-bootstrap-summary, the differences between our original model and the means of the boostrapped samples can be seen in the bootstrap bias (`bootBias`).

::: {#tbl-bootstrap-summary}
```{r bootstrap-summary, echo = FALSE}

#bootstrap_summary <- summary(bootstrap_final_model)

#kable(bootstrap_summary)
```

Bootstrap Statistics for the Final Model
:::

For most predictors, the bootstrap bias is very small (at or below 0.05), indicating that they are stable. The bias for `subj_animacyinanimate`, however, stands out slightly at -0.051, which may indicate some instability across bootstrap samples. This could also affect the interaction `subj_animacyinanimate:adversativitynon-adversative`, which is based on the same predictor. As can be seen in @fig-density-animacy, the distribution for `subj_animacyinanimate` deviates somewhat from a bell shape, centering around the bootstrap median -1.46 (`bootMed`), which supports the interpretation of reduced robustness.

```{r bootstrap-df, include = FALSE}

#bootstrap_df <- as.data.frame(bootstrap_final_model$t)

#colnames(bootstrap_df) <- names(fixef(final_model))

# geom_density(fill = "lightblue") +

# theme_minimal()

```

Bootstrapped Distribution of the `subj_animacyinanimate` Variable
:::

In contrast, the distribution for the significant main effect `clustercommunication` in @fig-density-cluster is approximately bell-shaped and centers closely around the original value of 1.80, which confirms its stability and positive effect. However, both verb cluster predictors, `clustercommunication` and `clusterhitting-touching`, have higher standard errors in the bootstrap statistics compared to the other fixed effects, which indicates greater uncertainty.

Surprisingly, and contrary to our initial hypothesis, the only significant main effect in our model is the semantic verb cluster, with communication verbs favouring [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}.

and the logistic regression model revealed a significant interaction between subject animacy and adversativity

## Subject responsibility

This section examines the results for the predictors related to subject responsibility. Although subject animacy shows a significant main effect, it cannot be interpreted in isolation, as it is shaped by its interaction with adversativity. No significant effects were found for the *complément d’agent*, or modal verbs factors, and they will therefore not be discussed further. While subject gender does not reach statistical significance, its distribution may suggest a potential tendency.

```

As outlined in @sec-subj-resp, subject animacy is linked to subject responsibility or affectedness. @tbl-animacy illustrates the absolute and relative frequencies of the subject animacy levels for [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} in our data. With [être]{.smallcaps} inanimate subjects occur more frequently than animate ones (`r   paste0(animate_etre_rel * 100, "%")` animate, `r   paste0(inaninmate_etre_rel * 100, "%")` inanimate), whereas [se faire]{.smallcaps} shows a strong preference for animate subjects (`r   paste0(animate_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")` animate, `r   paste0(inanimate_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")` inanimate). This distribution aligns with our expectations for [se faire]{.smallcaps}, but contradicts our hypothesis for [être]{.smallcaps}, which we also expected to occur more frequently with animate than with inanimate subjects. The findings for [se faire]{.smallcaps} replicate previous research [e.g. @novakova_construction_2009] and support the consensus that [se faire]{.smallcaps} strongly prefers animate subjects (@sec-subj-resp). If subject animacy is taken as an indicator of subject affectedness, the distribution suggests that subjects of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are likely being more affected by the event than those of [être.]{.smallcaps}

Absolute and Relative Frequencies of the Subject Animacy Levels for [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}
:::

The main effect of subject animacy in the logistic regression model cannot be interpreted in isolation as it is distorted by the significant interaction with adversativity. The interaction of these two factors and their predictions for the choice between [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} are described in @sec-results-adversativity, while their implications for subject responsibility are further explored in @sec-discussion.

### Subject gender

```{r freq-gender, include = FALSE}

freq_gender <- passive_sample_clean |>

gender_table <- table(passive_sample_clean$subj_gender, passive_sample_clean$passive_variant)

gender_prop <- prop.table(table(passive_sample_clean$subj_gender))
  
```

In total, our sample comprises `r   sum(gender_table["masculine", ])` masculine subjects (`r   paste0(round(gender_prop["masculine"], 2) * 100, "%")`) and `r   sum(gender_table["feminine", ])` feminine subjects (`r   paste0(round(gender_prop["feminine"], 2) * 100, "%")`) across all [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions. This distribution reflects an overall lower representation of feminine subjects compared to masculine subjects, particularly in [se faire]{.smallcaps}, as shown in @tbl-gender, in line with our hypothesis in @sec-subj-resp. While these frequencies suggest a bias towards masculine subjects, gender did not have a statistically significant effect in the logistic regression model and the frequencies should therefore be interpreted with caution.

Absolute and Relative Frequencies of the Subject Gender Levels for [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}
:::

The interaction between gender and animacy was also not significant. However, as can be seen in the barplots in @fig-gender-animacy, for both passive variants animate subjects are predominantly masculine, while inanimate subjects are more frequently feminine. [être]{.smallcaps} occurs most frequently with inanimate feminine subjects, while the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive occurs most frequently with animate masculine subjects. This distribution supports the hypothesis that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is more frequent with animate male subjects than with animate female subjects. For inanimate subjects, the difference in frequency between masculine and feminine gender is smaller compared to animate subjects, suggesting that the influence of gender on the choice of passive variant could be less strong for inanimate subjects than for animate ones. Given the sparse data for [se faire]{.smallcaps} with inanimate subjects and the lack of statistical significance, these patterns should be interpreted with caution.

However, adversative constructions were more common with [se faire]{.smallcaps} than with [être]{.smallcaps}: while only about one fifth (`r   paste0(adversative_etre_rel * 100, "%")`) of [être]{.smallcaps} were adversative, this was the case for two fifths (`r   paste0(adversative_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")`) of [se faire]{.smallcaps}. The mosaic plot in @fig-adversativity illustrates the distribution of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} across the adversativity levels (non-adversative/adversative).

Proportional Distribution of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} across the Adversativity Levels

interaction_pvalue <- coefficients["subj_animacyinanimate:adversativitynon-adversative", 4]

```

The logistic regression model revealed a highly significant interaction between subject animacy and adversativity with an odds ratio of `r   round(interaction_odds_ratio, 2)` and a confidence interval of `r   paste0(round(interaction_ci_min, 2), "-", round(interaction_ci_max, 2))` ($p$-value = `r   format(round(interaction_pvalue, 5), scientific = FALSE)`, rounded to 0.001 in the model output). This means that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is `r   round(interaction_odds_ratio, 2)` times as likely as [être]{.smallcaps} when the subject is inanimate and the context is non-adversative, so in these contexts, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is significantly less likely than [être]{.smallcaps}. Conversely, since the categories are binary, this also implies that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is much more likely in adversative contexts and with animate subjects than [être]{.smallcaps}.

As @fig-animacy-adversativity-log shows, animate subjects strongly favour [se faire]{.smallcaps} regardless of adversativity, with only a slight increase of its likelihood in adversative contexts. For inanimate subjects, however, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is much more likely in adversative contexts (40%), while [être]{.smallcaps} is almost exclusively used in non-adversative ones.

Even though an analysis of the most frequent lemmas shows that [se faire]{.smallcaps} most frequent verbs *insulter* and *engueuler* are adversative, there was no significant interaction effect of adversativity and cluster.

  pull(`relative_se faire`)

```

As can be seen from the distribution of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} across different verb clusters in @tbl-cluster, neutral verbs are the most frequent category in both passive variants, making up `r   paste0(neutral_etre_rel * 100, "%")` of all [être]{.smallcaps} constructions and `r   paste0(neutral_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")` of all [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions. [se faire]{.smallcaps} is relatively more frequent with communication verbs (`r   paste0(communication_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")`) and hitting-touching verbs (`r   paste0(hittingtouching_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")`) compared to [être]{.smallcaps} (`r   paste0(communication_etre_rel * 100, "%")` and `r   paste0(hittingtouching_etre_rel * 100, "%")`).

Surprisingly, and contrary to our initial hypothesis, the only significant main effect in our model is the semantic verb cluster, with communication verbs favouring [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}. We had predicted that hitting-touching verbs would favour [se faire]{.smallcaps}, given their dynamic and adversative nature, while communication verbs would be more compatible with [être]{.smallcaps}, as they typically feature an animate subject and frequently occur with object complements. However, in our model, the odds of [se faire]{.smallcaps} occurring with communication verbs are `r   round(communication_odds_ratio, 2)` times higher than with verbs in the "neutral" category (CI: `r   paste0(round(ci_min, 2), "-", round(ci_max, 2))`, $p$-value = `r   round(communication_pvalue, 3)`). In contrast, hitting-touching verbs, which we expected to strongly favour [se faire]{.smallcaps}, did not show a significant effect.

cluster_predicted <- ggpredict(final_model, "cluster")

neutral_predicted <- cluster_predicted |>

  pull(predicted)

```

@fig-cluster-model-plot shows the predicted probabilities of [se faire]{.smallcaps} for each verb cluster, along with the confidence intervals. Note that these predictions are based on the context of animate subjects and adversative verbs, which are the reference levels in our model. For this reason, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is favoured over [être]{.smallcaps} for all three verb cluster categories. Communication verbs have the highest predicted probability of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, (`r   paste0(round(communication_predicted * 100, 2), "%")`). This supports our surprising finding that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is preferred for communication verbs, contrary to our hypothesis. Neutral verbs show a lower probability (`r   paste0(round(neutral_predicted * 100, 2), "%")`) suggesting a weaker preference for [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}. Hitting-touching verbs have a probability of (`r   paste0(round(hittingtouching_predicted * 100, 2), "%")`), but their confidence interval overlaps with that of neutral verbs, indicating no significant difference between these two categories. The wide confidence intervals, particularly for hitting-touching verbs, suggest a variability or uncertainty in the estimates, which aligns with the non-significant effect found for this category in our statistical model.

Predicted Probabilities of [se faire]{.smallcaps} Across the Verb Clusters
:::

Examining the most frequent communication verb lemmas in our data in @tbl-cluster-lemmas, we find that *insulter* (10 occurrences), *engueuler* (7 occurrences), and *représenter* (5 occurrences) appear most often with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Notably, *insulter* and *engueuler* are dynamic and adversative verbs, which may behave similarly to hitting-touching verbs, and typically occur with an animate undergoer - possibly explaining their preference for [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Conversely, the most frequent lemmas with [être]{.smallcaps} are *appeler*, *inscrire*, *rappeler*, and *représenter* (each with 4 occurences), which are annotated as non-adversative in our dataset, except for one occurence.

Frequencies of Lemmas in the Communication Verb Cluster for [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}
:::

Given this pattern, in line with our initial hypothesis one possible explanation is that adversativity influences the choice of [se faire]{.smallcaps} within the communication verb cluster. However, there was no significant interaction between the verb cluster and the adversativity factor.

As shown by the absolute frequencies of verb clusters across adversativity levels in @fig-interaction-adv-cluster, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is used more frequently with adversative communication verbs than with non-adversative communication verbs, while the opposite pattern can be observed for [être]{.smallcaps}. However, this trend is not strong enough to be statistically significant. @fig-interaction-adv-cluster also illustrates that neutral, non-adversative verbs are predominant with [être]{.smallcaps}, which reflects that [être]{.smallcaps} is the default passive variant.

:::

Similarly to the adversativity of the verb, the animacy of the subject could play a role in the distribution of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} with communication verbs like *insulter* and *engueuler*, which typically occur with an animate undergoer. Again, a trend can be observed in the frequencies, but there is no significant interaction between the verb cluster and the animacy factors. @fig-interaction-anim-cluster shows the absolute frequencies of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} across verb clusters and subject animacy. [être]{.smallcaps} is more frequent with communication verbs when the subject is inanimate, whereas [se faire]{.smallcaps} is more common with communication verbs when the subject is animate.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

As the multifaceted and partly conflicting literature suggests, the passive is a complex and nuanced phenomenon. This entails some challenges for the systematic study of both passive alternations in general, and of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} specifically. Firstly, the variable context is necessarily broad due to [se faire]{.smallcaps}'s similarity to the structurally identical causative construction. As has been shown, several borderline cases can be interpreted as either causative or passive (sometimes even both) depending on the specific context. Similarly, [être]{.smallcaps} constructions range between the stative passive and the progressive passive, with the former sometimes being indistingushable from adjectival constructions. Decisions had to be made regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria; however, a different set of choices could have been equally justified and might have yielded different results. It could be valuable to examine the cases we excluded from our analysis to understand how they differ from genuine passive constructions. This would provide insight into the gray area where passive nuances are present, but no true alternation occurs, allowing for a closer examination of varying degrees of passivity.

-   Verbs like *insulter* (and *engueuler*, which is also frequent with *se faire*) are **colloquial and adversative**, making them more prone to occur with *se faire* rather than the more neutral *être*.
-   **verb cluster main effect; interaction with adversativity:** One possible explanation is that certain communication verbs, particularly those with an adversative nuance like *insulter* and *engueuler*, pattern similar to hitting-touching verbs, emphasising the subject’s affectedness. Alternatively, this could reflect a more general tendency for [se faire]{.smallcaps} to appear in contexts where the subject is undergoing an action with a certain intensity, which might be more common with communication verbs than initially assumed?
-   Regarding the animacy factor, initially, we expected the animacy of the subject to have a stronger effect if the verb is from the "hitting-touching" or the "neutral" category. [se faire]{.smallcaps} would be strongly favoured with animate subjects compared to inanimate subjects, while this effect would be weaker with communication verbs, which could favour [être]{.smallcaps} regardless of animacy.

With regard to our hypotheses, although few significant effects were found, the strong interaction of subject animacy and adversativity clearly shows that [se faire]{.smallcaps} predominently occurs with animate subjects and in adversative contexts. Subject animacy seems to be the main mediating factor: [se faire]{.smallcaps} is very likely for animate subjects in both adversative and non-adversative contexts while its likelihood decreases significantly for inanimate subjects. This is in line with the vast previous evidence on [se faire]{.smallcaps}'s preference for animate subjects [@koenig_semantic_1992; @novakova_construction_2009: 111-112; @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967; @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987; @raineri_analyse_2010: 92]. However, our analysis challenge the claim by @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 and @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 that [se faire]{.smallcaps} strictly requires an animate subject: Our data provide evidence of inanimate subjects occuring with [se faire]{.smallcaps} (7%). Consequently, our model predicts that while [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a high chance to occur with animate subjects, it may also be found with inanimate subjects, particularly in adversative contexts.

However(, as @kupferman_construction_1995 argues,) even a strong correlation of animate subjects, adversative verbs and [se faire]{.smallcaps} does not necessarily imply that the subject is responsible for the event and brings negative consequences upon themselves. Instead, the increased likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} with inanimate subjects in adversative contexts compared to non-adversative contexts suggests that the construction emphasises subject affectedness more than [être]{.smallcaps}. \[Note, however, that inter-rater agreement was lowest for adversativity, suggesting some ambiguity regarding this factor, although it was still considered 'substantial'\]. Overall, we consider these findings to support the theory of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being preferred over canoncial [être]{.smallcaps} when marking subject affectedness.

The remaining factors used to test subject responsibility (subject gender, complement d'agent, modal) did not yield significant effects. This may be taken as further indication for... / this may further strenghthen an argument against subject responsibility and toward subject affectness// The absence of additional significant effects related to subject responsibility may further support this notion.

-   problematic category gender/ unknown; no real effect of gender - maybe tendency?

-   no effects of modal: summarising tense aspect and mood in a tam category of "progressivity" with strict classification of tenses (although sometimes not fitting in context) potentially problematic (but also needed to ensure inter-rater agreement and limited by the fact that neither of the authors is a native speaker of French) - overall labeling maybe not nuanced enough? The "modal" category in our study only includes modal verbs. Other similar constructions that express subject responsibility, such as *avoir besoin de*, *arriver à*, *réussir à*, *envier de*, *avoir des difficultés pour*, *avoir la possibilité de*, and *avoir envie de*, etc. could also be interesting to examine in future research.

-   regarding aspectuality

    -   cluster effect: communication with [se faire]{.smallcaps}; (also preferred with hitting-touching verbs but non-signficant)

    -   random effect of lemma accounts for a lot of the variance - agrees with Bohmann [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 48] who reports evidence that the English \[get\] passive, which has been shown to be similar to [se faire]{.smallcaps} in several regards, "is largely lexically conditioned"

One limitation of our study is that the predictions of our model do not directly reflect real-life language use, as [être]{.smallcaps} is far more common than [se faire]{.smallcaps}, which is comparatively rare (ratio in ParlaMint: 324,836 (38.300) être: 1,254 se faire). We created a balanced data set based on [se faire]{.smallcaps} lemmas to prevent our model from being dominated by frequency effects produced by extreme data unbalance.[^4] This approach allowed us to investigate the factors influencing passive choice and their complex interplay. However, it must be kept in mind that this ratio is artificial does not reflect the reality of passive use, in which [être]{.smallcaps} is chosen as the default in most contexts, and [se faire]{.smallcaps} remains a marked exception.

[^4]: Note that the ratio ended up not being exactly 50:50 because we had to exclude the gender "unknown" which removed 165 se faire and only 29 être constructions. However, this is is still much more balanced than the actual ratio.

-   refer to Bootstrap validation results

A limitation of our study is that the lemmas were determined based on those occurring in *se faire* constructions, which may have influenced the analysis.

"Both the potential insights and the problems entailed by this approach are considerable." [@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 49]

-   interaction animacy x gender: *personne* (feminine) occurs frequently in the sample

(Telicity seems to be another important distinction: According to @bellec_construction_2014 \[209\], the *être* passive is likely to describe a result or mark an endpoint of an action, while the *se faire* passive is used for actions in progress and verbs that are in their nature ongoing (e.g. perception verbs, @bellec_construction_2014 [209]). This could be reflected in the telicity of the verb, with telic verbs preferring the *être* passive and atelic verbs favouring the *se faire* passive.)

-   implications for causativity debate?

-   Gender: we did not differentiate between humans/non-humans

Dataset/sample: problem: data are extremely unbalanced (ratio in ParlaMint être vs. se faire: ) -\\\> making the ratio 50: 50 would distort the reality significantly but if the ratio is kept the model will almost always predict êtrestrategy possibilities: - build a corpus where être is presented more than se faire but not as extreme (approximation, e.g. 40% se faire - 60% etre) ("over/undersampling within limits") - assign more weight to se faire constructions by "weights=" variable of glm function - \@bohmann_large-scale_2023 kept the imbalance (ca. 3 Mio be passive vs. 25 000 get passive) - evaluate with precision & recall, not just accuracy (F1-score)

As some linguists (e.g., Martin, Novakova / ... as above?) argue, *se faire* + infinitive can sometimes have a 'passive effect' even without a direct 1:1 alternation with *être*.

potential problems revealed in diagnostics: suboptimal fit for some data (binned residuals) and bootstrap validation (convergence issues & minimal bias)

# Conclusion

-   Future studies: modality (spoken/written) as a factor (compare modalities), analyses on other modalities/varieties/registers

    -   Overall, [être]{.smallcaps} is more frequently used in written French than in spoken French [@da2022alternance: 76-77].

-   se faire passive more likely in informal settings, être passive more likely in formal settings

-   definiteness & pronominality of the subject

-   memory-based learning
