# Introduction

The French construction *se faire* followed by an infinitive has evolved through analogy with the passive voice. Originally, it had a causative meaning, where the subject played an active role in the action. However, in some contexts, it can also be interpreted as passive, alternating with the *être* passive construction.

This study investigates the factors that influence the choice between *se faire* and *être* in the passive alternation in spoken French, with a particular focus on parliamentary debates. Specifically, we aim to understand what factors contribute to speakers’ preference for one construction over the other.

To address this question, we use a quantitative, multivariate, probabilistic approach to model corpus data. Our results show a main effect of semantic verb clusters, with communication verbs tending to favour *se faire* over *être* in passive constructions.

# The French passive alternation of *être* and *se faire*

## Canonical passive with *être* {#sec-etre}

### Structure and meaning

The canonical passive with *être* in French inverts the syntactic functions of the arguments within a clause. The object of the active sentence, i.e. the undergoer, becomes the subject in the passive voice - a phenomenon known as diathesis. In French, the subject typically occupies the first position in a sentence. In the *être* passive construction, the undergoer is placed in this initial position, which results in topicalisation. This syntactic shift directs the focus away from the actor and onto the undergoer.

The French *être* passive construction consists of a form of the attributive verb *être* and the *participe passif* (passive participle), which is identical in form to the *participe passé* (past participle). Although other attributive verbs, such as *rester* and *sembler*, can also be used in passive constructions, they are less common. This term paper will focus specifically on the passive formed with *être*. In the passive construction, the subject of the active sentence becomes an adjunct phrase (*complément d'agent*), introduced by *par* or *de*, which can be omitted. The construction is referred to as *passif long* when a *complément d'agent* is present, and *passif court* when the agent is omitted [@abeille2021grande 210-211].

For example, in the following sentences from our sample from the French ParlaMint 2.1 corpus [@11356/1431], in 1.a the agent *nos concitoyens* appears in the *complément d'agent* introduced by *par*, while in 1.b the agent is omitted:

> (1) 
>
>     (a) *\[...\] ils sont élus par nos concitoyens au suffrage universel.*\
>         "\[...\] they are elected by our fellow citizens through universal suffrage."
>     (b) *Les députés sont élus pour contrôler votre action.*\
>         "The members of parliament are elected to monitor your actions."

An **impersonal passive** (*passif impersonnel*) is also possible in French. With impersonal passives, the direct object can remain as a complement, as in *Il sera acheté un livre* (‘A book will be bought’) [@abeille2021grande 210].

Some grammars distinguish between a *passif verbal*, with an event interpretation, and an *passif adjectival*, with a resultative interpretation. According to *La grande grammaire du français* [@abeille2021grande], this is about semantic differences, concerning the aspect of the situation. With a state verb, active and passive sentences are generally semantically equivalent (Tout le monde aime Marie. / Marie est aimée de tout de monde.). With an event verb, expressing a change of state or place, the passive describes a change in the initial situation or the result of this change. In the passé composé, the sentences *On a servi la biere* and *La bière a été servi* appear to be equivalent. In the present tense, on the other hand, or in the imperfect tense, the active phrase (On sert la bière) may describe a situation in progress, and the passive phrase a resulting state (La bière est servi). In the passive, the presence of an agent complement can favour the interpretation of an event, with a present tense of habit (La bière est servi par le patron). The passive court without an agent generally has the effect of presenting the situation without specifying the cause or the individual who is responsible. Its semantic focus lies on the action or the result of the action. [@abeille2021grande 219].

**vs. adjectives**

(The passive voice is relatively rare in French, accounting for only 5% of verbs in the French Treebank (FTB) (\@da_cunha_lalternance_2020), compared to 9% in English for the same text type (\@roland2007frequency). Overall, the passive voice is more frequently used in written French than in spoken French (\@da2022alternance). Approximately a quarter of passive constructions in the FTB are *passif long* (\@da_cunha_lalternance_2020), while in spoken French, this proportion drops to about 10% (source: Hamma). **-\> frequency in our corpus?**)

We will refer to this with [être.]{.smallcaps}

## [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive

```{=html}
<!--  Historical background

@bellec_grammaticalisation_2015 and @bellec_quand_2014 date the se faire + INF passive construction (PSF) to the middle of the 20th century and call it a "modern" construction that has since experienced a rapid increase in popularity. She describes a process of grammaticalisation and reanalysis for the PSF during/through which “se” has lost its reflexive meaning and “faire” has become an auxiliary. In merging, they form a “semi-auxiliary” and obtain a passive interpretation, while the causative meaning is lost (désémantisation). However, @bellec_construction_2014 claims that the causative reading did not disappear but instead coexists with the passive reading (debated, see below).

-   In contrast, @raineri_analyse_2010 [280-305] based on corpus data: sees origin much earlier, exists since origin of Middle French (14-17th century); NOT derived from causative reading, increased productivity from 19th century onward 
-   se faire passive "typologically marked", comparison to other Romance languages @koenig_semantic_1992 \[145\]; similar constructions exist in other Romance languages but passive reading only allowed in French @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 [236] -->
```
### Structure and meaning

When constructing a passive sentence, French speakers may choose to use [se faire]{.smallcaps} instead of the canonical [être]{.smallcaps}: The [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive construction, hereinafter called [se faire]{.smallcaps}, provides an alternative way to express passive meaning in French. [se faire]{.smallcaps} has been widely investigated and discussed, for example by @bellec_construction_2014, @gaatone_desagreable_1983, @koenig_semantic_1992, @kupferman_construction_1995, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013, @raineri_analyse_2010, @novakova_construction_2009, and @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987.

[se faire]{.smallcaps} consists of the pronoun *se* (which shows agreement with the subject), a form of the verb *faire* ('to do'), and a verb in the infinitive (3.). When used with intransitive verbs, the construction has no passive sense. Its meaning is then composed of the literal meaning of its components (4.):

> 3.  *Elle se faire rire.* [@kupferman_construction_1995: 61]\
>     'She made herself laugh.'
>
> 4.  *Des policiers se font agresser.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     'Police officers are attacked.'

[se faire]{.smallcaps} resembles [être]{.smallcaps} in that the direct object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. This subject is the experiencer of the action described. Different than with [être]{.smallcaps}, however, the diathesis is not restricted to the direct object: [se faire]{.smallcaps} has "greater syntactic flexibility" [@raineri_analyse_2010: 93-95] and can also occur with ditransitive verbs, where the indirect object becomes the subject, as demonstrated by the following example 5.

> 5.  *Les intéressés peuvent se faire expliquer tout ce qui touche aux retraites.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     'Interested parties can have everything related to pensions explained to them.'

[se faire]{.smallcaps} can also be used to express active involvement of the subject while still conveying a sense of subject undergoing.

> 6.  *Oh... tu t'es fait couper les cheveux pour l' été!* [@raineri_analyse_2010: 156]\
>     'Oh.. you've had you hair cut for summer!'

However, constructions like 6. are controversial: Sveberg [-@sveberg_se_2012: 164-165] argues that such instances of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are fundamentally causative rather than passive, since the subject both initiates and undergoes the action (as in: 'You've made the hairdresser cut your hair'). The semantic tension between the fundamentally causative nature of the verb *faire* and the passive reading has been discussed extensively in the literature. Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 235] classifies the construction as “formally causative, but semantically passive”. This apparent contradiction has led scholars to question the nature of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, as Koenig and Pederson [-@koenig_semantic_1992: 145] put it: "how can a passive-like construction arise from a combination of a causative and a reflexive marker, where no marking of the passive function is apparent?".

Various answers to this question have been proposed: @kupferman_construction_1995 sees the causative and passive readings as homonyms with fundamentally different semantics. According to him, se faire is always causative when used with an intransitive verb (ex. 5), but always passive when used with "non-agentive" predicates [@kupferman_construction_1995: 61]. This is in line with Bellec [-@bellec_construction_2014; -@bellec_quand_2014], who takes a diachronic approach: She describes a process of grammaticalisation and reanalysis for [se faire]{.smallcaps} through which *se* lost its reflexive meaning and *faire* became an auxiliary. According to her, the causative meaning has not disappeared but now coexists with the passive reading. Notably, Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 280-305]'s corpus study suggests that the [se faire]{.smallcaps} did not derive from the causative reading but evolved independently.

Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 23] adopts a syntactic approach, proposing that the passive meaning is derived through a mechanism that links the empty NP-object position of the embedded verb to the subject via *se*. This binding causes the subject to be interpreted as affected, as it is coindexed with the missing object, which would be affected in the active sentence but is absent on the surface in [se faire]{.smallcaps}. This interpretation works only when the embedded verb has an agentive subject, as the missing object must be affected. The subject therefore remains the agent of the action, but the construction is interpreted as passive because the subject is also affected by the action of the embedded verb.

These accounts offer only a brief glimpse into the complex analysis of [se faire]{.smallcaps}. How does the passive reading emerge, and how does it differ from the syntactically identical causative reading? These questions remain controversial, and will be discussed in the following @sec-debate. The following @sec-debate will explore the controversial issues surrounding the passive reading, including its distinction from the syntactically identical causative reading.

### Passive vs. causative: the debated passive status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} {#sec-debate}

The above-described stance taken by @bellec_construction_2014, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013, @koenig_semantic_1992 and @kupferman_construction_1995 that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a full-fledged passive construction and clearly separated from the causative is by no means undisputed. The opposing view - that the construction is a type of causative - is also widely represented in the literature. There is also the possibility of a multitude of readings [@kokutani_sur_2005] and of a continuum between causative and passive [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 89, 154-166].

It is most prominently presented by @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 and has more recently been reworked by @sveberg_se_2012. In their view, the passive of [se faire]{.smallcaps} emerges only from the context, not from the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction itself. They centre their argumentation around the notion that the subject of [se faire]{.smallcaps} "is always, even unconsciously, responsible for the occurrence of the embedded event."

Koenig [-@koenig_semantic_1992: 143] points out that sentences including [se faire]{.smallcaps} can have both a passive and a causative sense. We find examples of this in the ParlaMint corpus, such as 7.:

> 7.  *\[...\] il y a \[…\] des parlementaires qui **se sont fait élire** sur la promesse de ne pas supprimer 120 000 postes.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     '\[...\] there are \[…\] Members of Parliament who **were elected** on the promise not to cut 120,000 jobs.'\
>     '\[...\] there are \[…\] Members of Parliament who **made themselves be elected** on the promise not to cut 120,000 jobs.'

As Washio [-@washio_when_1993: 45] describes, the linguistic proximity of causativity and passivity is not exclusive for French but quite typical in cross-linguistic contexts, stating that "passive and causative senses are shown to share a basic conceptual structure" across the world's languages. Crucially, passive and causative [se faire]{.smallcaps} are structurally identical, differing only in their semantics. According to Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 236] the ambiguity is resolved by the semantic nature of the three main components: subject referent, *se* and *faire*. Referring to these three components, Bellec [-@bellec_construction_2014: 207] defines the following criteria for a causative reading, which distinguish the causative from the passive interpretation:

-   In the causative, the subject referent is agentive and has the role of both causer and patient. The subject actively initiates what happens to them. In the passive, the subject referent has only the role of the patient and is affected by the event.
-   In the causative reading, the particle *se* has a reflexive meaning whereas in the passive reading, *se* is not reflexive.
-   In the causative reading, *faire* has transparent causative meaning. This causative meaning is lost in the passive reading, where *faire* has no inherent meaning. <!-- add: how will we distinguish them / have we distinguished them in our study -->

Sometimes both readings are possible and the ambiguity cannot be resolved [@koenig_semantic_1992: 144], especially with cognition and perception verbs [@bellec_construction_2014: 206-207]. Therefore, despite its productivity as a passive construction, Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 356-357] concludes that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is problematic because it does not fit into two distinct categories nor does it function as a single weak causative.

<!-- In the causative reading, "se" is understood as reflexive and "faire" as causative. In contrast, in the causative reading, if interpreted as a passive, the meanings of "se" and "faire" are not transparent. Thus, the subject referent does not necessarily cause the event and is not necessarily responsible (@koenig_semantic_1992\[143\]: "any notion of causation is absent"). -->

This debate has been central to the investigation of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and cannot be left aside. However, even if the status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} has been the subject of disagreement and discussion, the literature clearly shows that there is a passive reading associated with this construction. This is independent of whether the passive sense emerges from within the construction or from the components it occurs with, or whether it has an underlying causative meaning. By comparing [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} constructions, and examining the factors contributing to the choice of one or the other, we aim to shed light on this debate from a corpuslinguistic perspective. <!-- (-> exclude causative readings?). Can our findings contribute to the debate of whether se faire deserves passive-status? If not: no need to spell out the debate in detail. -->

## [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}: competition or complementation? {#sec-factors}

### Defining the variable context {#sec-sefaire-context}

Both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} passives are available for the active diathesis [@novakova_construction_2009 :108] and assign the role of the undergoer to the subject referent. Therefore, the two variants form an alternation and are expected to compete with each other in contexts where passive is expressed. We find that both variants may be used in the same context:

> 8.  *Je remarque d' ailleurs que ce sont souvent ceux qui filment qui **se font éborgner** ou **sont blessés** par des tirs de LBD*. (ParlaMint)\
>     'Incidentally, I've noticed that it's often those filming who **get their eyes poked out** or **are injured** by LBD fire.'

However, some scholars speak of semantic differences between the canonical être passive and [se faire]{.smallcaps}: As Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 108] notes, the constructions differ in semantic nuances, as they have *un sens proche mais pas identique* ('a similar but not identical sense').

According to Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 87], [se faire]{.smallcaps} is marked and predominantly used in informal contexts. In contrast to canonical [être]{.smallcaps}, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is reported to prefer spoken over written language (**source?**). Additionally, [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a strongly figurative sense that [être]{.smallcaps} is missing: It is often used as part of idiomatic or lexicalised expressions [@raineri_analyse_2010: 165; @novakova_construction_2009: 117], and is associated with a "besoin d’expressivité and extravagance" ('a need of expressivity and extravagance') [@bellec_construction_2014: 206].

Previous research also suggests that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is more likely to have a causative undertone while [être]{.smallcaps} is more neutral. As discussed in @sec-debate, it has been proposed that the constructions vary in their degree of passivity and that there exists a continuum between causatitivity and passivity within [se faire]{.smallcaps} [@raineri_analyse_2010: 154-166], and some constructions may be more passive than others. This demonstrates that the two passive variants are not semantically identical but rather carry subtly different meanings. These differences may be more or less pronounced depending on the context. They introduce certain challenges in the contrastive analysis of the alternation and deciding where to draw the line between passive and causative is a nuanced task. Bohmann et al. [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 35-36] face similar challenges when defining the variable context of the English passive alternation of [be]{.smallcaps} and [get]{.smallcaps}.

Since our aim is to investigate the passive alternation of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}, we aim to to ensure that we only compare [être]{.smallcaps} passive with real passive [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions, and not with causative constructions. We follow Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 165] in including only [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions that have a natural paraphrase with [être]{.smallcaps} in order to investigate only constructions participating in the alternation. Agreeing with Bohmann [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 35] who claim that "all extracted forms should be genuine instances of the variable under investigation" and that "only cases where both variants can be used interchangeably should be considered", we aim to exclude non-contrastive constructions, such as idioms and ditransitive verbs. We explain our criteria for excluding constructions in detail in @sec-filtering-criteria.

We recognize this "fuzzy" [@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 50] variable context as both a challenge and an opportunity: It is precisely these subtle differences that make the analysis interesting and our research valuable. Consequently, our study seeks to identify the exact factors influencing the choice between the two variants by statistically modeling real language data. Our central research question is: What factors determine the [se faire]{.smallcaps}: [être]{.smallcaps} passive alternation in spoken French, specifically in parliamentary debates? In other words: what factors influence speakers’ choice between these two constructions? In the following sections, we outline the factors we anticipate will shape this choice and present our hypotheses of passive preference.

<!-- être: exclude adjectives and some participles that do not form the passive (similar to @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [36])/ "instances that allow for gradation" @hundt_be-_2024 [92];; Maybe better in Borderline cases/ filtering criteria) -->

```{=html}
<!-- Several corpus studies on voice choice in French have shown that the choice between active and passive constructions (*être* passive) is not purely syntactic, but that semantic and pragmatic factors also play a crucial role in determining whether a passive construction is favoured.

-   Subjects in passive sentences are preferably animate, definite, and pronominal. In the study by @da_cunha_lalternance_2020, animate, definite, and pronominal arguments that function as the objects in active sentences were more frequently found in the passive (and vice versa). -\> prominence / informational structure as significant factor. (And: constituent length, shorter constituents are preferred in subject position and favour the passive voice) -->
```
### Subject responsibility

As indicated above, the question whether the referent of the subject in the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction holds any responsibility is central to the debate of the construction's passive-status (see above; @sveberg_se_2012, @bellec_construction_2014 :212-213). In line with their argument that the passive reading of [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a kind of causative, @gaatone_desagreable_1983 and @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 state that the subject referent of [se faire]{.smallcaps} is always a causer and therefore always responsible to some degree. This is contrasted to the être passive's subject referent, which is seen as more neutral. Gaatone [-@gaatone_desagreable_1983: 164] distinguishes between an "active patient" in [se faire]{.smallcaps} and a "passive patient" in the être passive [@raineri_analyse_2010: 96].

<!-- whether the passive reading of se faire is a type of the causative reading or its own instance -->

```{=html}
<!--  However, there is general consensus that
the PSF construction has a preference to mark the subject as an active participant (although according to @raineri_analyse_2010 [98] is is not "universally accepted" as some authors also name counterexamples @kupferman_construction_1995 [59].)
In @raineri_analyse_2010 [95]'s view, the idea that the PSF expresses subject responsibility is the "most common hypothesis" ("l'hypothèse la plus répandue") in the literature. -->
```
In contrast, Kupferman [-@kupferman_construction_1995: 59] gives [se faire]{.smallcaps} examples where the subject cannot possibly be interpreted as responsible, one of which is repeated here:

> 9.  *Elle sanglotait parce que son tout jeune bébé venait de se faire enlever les amygdales.* [@kupferman_construction_1995: 59]\
>     'She sobbed because her little baby got operated on for tonsilitis.'

According to him, subject responsibility emerges from the context and not from the inherently passive [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction [@kupferman_construction_1995: 98-99]. Further support for this idea comes from @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 and @washio_when_1993. For @martin_construction_2002, subject dynamism, but not subject intentionality, is a necessary condition [@raineri_analyse_2010: 90].

Thus, although the requirement of subject responsibility in [se faire]{.smallcaps} is not "universally accepted" [@raineri_analyse_2010: 98], ("une catégorie hétérogène complexe" (@raineri_analyse_2010 [249]), the analyses show some consensus in that [se faire]{.smallcaps} prefers to mark the subject as connected to the event [@raineri_analyse_2010], either through affectedness, responsibility or intentionality. We expect that his tendency is less pronounced for the être passive. In our study, we model subject responsibility by the factors subject animacy, subject gender, Complément d'agent, and modal verbs. Our overarching hypothesis is that [se faire]{.smallcaps} will be favoured over [être]{.smallcaps} in constructions with responsible subjects, indicated by animate, masculine subjects, the absence of complément d'agents and the presence of modal verbs.

**Subject Animacy**

Corpus studies have shown that animacy significantly influences voice choice in French. The animacy of the passive subject (not agent) has been shown to increase the likelihood of using the passive voice (*être* passive) over the active voice. @da_cunha_lalternance_2020 (+ @da2022alternance) -\> more explanation as to why

As implied in the debate on subject responsibility, subjects of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are predominantly active participants in the described action. Since inanimate subjects are rarely affected and even less often responsible, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is common with animate subjects. While some scholars claim that only animate subjects are possible with the [se faire]{.smallcaps}, others provide counterexamples [@labelle_anticausativizing_2013; @kokutani_sur_2005, @novakova_construction_2009: 4; @sveberg_se_2012] (@raineri_analyse_2010 [92]).

However, these examples appear to be exceptions as there are both corpus [@novakova_construction_2009: 111] and experimental [@koenig_semantic_1992: 151, 153] evidence that subject animacy and [se faire]{.smallcaps} are positively correlated: In Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 111]'s corpus study, less than 3% of [se faire]{.smallcaps} sentences had inanimate subjects. In a survey by @koenig_semantic_1992, French native speakers rated the acceptability of [se faire]{.smallcaps} with animate subjects significantly higher than with inanimate subjects. Inanimate subjects were only allowed by some speakers when the subject "affects a relevant animate entity" [@koenig_semantic_1992: 151, 153]. Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 92] reflects that the preference of [se faire]{.smallcaps} to be realised with animate subjects is one of the few aspects on which scholars agree.

We tag animacy as binary *inanimate/ animate* although we recognize that animacy has been considered a hierarchical scale in the literature, most prominently by @zaenen_animacy_2004. Following @zaenen_animacy_2004, we understand organisations to be "collectivities of humans" and therefore annotate them as *animate*. In line with the literature, we hypothesise that both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} favour animate subjects over inanimate subjects but subject animacy is a stronger predictor of [se faire]{.smallcaps} than of [être]{.smallcaps}.

**Interaction**: @raineri_analyse_2010 [94] suspects that [se faire]{.smallcaps} restricts verb selection and provides an explanation for the construction's incompatibility with certain verbs. Therefore, we propose that passive choice could be influenced not only by animacy or verb cluster alone, but by the combination of these two factors: For example, animacy could have a stronger effect if the verb is from the hitting-touching category or the neutral category ([se faire]{.smallcaps} could be strongly favoured with animate subjects compared to inanimate subjects), while this effect could be weaker with communication verbs, for which [être]{.smallcaps} could be favoured regardless of animacy.

<!-- The preference of the se faire passive of animate over inanimate subjects is parallel to the English get passive (@hundt_be-_2024), although @raineri_analyse_2010 [92] finds that the get passive allows more inanimate subjects than the se faire passive. According to @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [43], the get passive has become more likely with inanimate subjects over time which may signify a lessening of subject responsibility. @raineri_analyse_2010 brings up the possibility that a similar process of grammaticalisation may be happening in French. (not sure if relevant)-->

**Gender**

Since previous research suggests that grammatical gender plays a role in voice choice, it is worth investigating whether this effect extends to the alternation between *être* and [se faire]{.smallcaps} passives.

@da_cunha_lalternance_2020 (+2022) found that in written French, a feminine agent increased the likelihood of *être* passives (in the passif court model, i.e. when the agent is omitted) over the active voice, with no interaction with animacy (whether the argument was human or non-human) \[or definiteness\]. This suggests that gender itself may directly influence voice choice. However, given the study’s small sample size, it is also possible that an interaction effect exists but was not statistically significant \[check 2022 study\].

Since we do not infer the agent from context in this study, our analysis focuses solely on the subject’s gender. If *se faire* passives favour subjects with high responsibility, salience or affectedness, the grammatical gender of the subject may influence the alternation between *se faire* and *être* passive. Specifically, if feminine referents are perceived as less active or agentive in certain contexts, a feminine subject may favour *être* passives over *se faire* passives.

To test this, we categorise gender into four levels: unknown, mixed, masculine, and feminine. Our hypothesis is that a feminine subject will favour the *être* passive and disfavor the *se faire* passive. We will test the potential interaction between gender and animacy, as the effect of grammatical gender may depend on whether the subject is animate or inanimate, potentially linking to the social gender of animate subject referents. Additionally, we will examine how unknown or mixed-gender subjects behave in terms of this alternation.

**Complément d'agent**

The *complément d'agent* introduces an external argument into the passive construction, typically referring to the causer or instigator of the action that is the driving force behind the event described. It is derived through diathesis from the subject of the corresponding active sentence (@sec-etre).

The *complément d'agent* is optional. It is usually formed with *par*, sometimes also with *de*, and even more rarely with *dans*. We do not consider the special case with *dans* in our analysis. In most cases, *de* alternates with *par*. The choice between *par* and *de* is not always interchangeable in meaning. For arguments introduced by *par* @kupferman_construction_1995 **(pages?)** postulates an "agentivity requirement", attributing strong responsibility to them. In contrast, *de* is generally associated with non-dynamic, static, or non-agentive interpretations. For instance, with the verb accompagner, a *complément d’agent* with par implies a more active role of the argument than with *de*. Some verbs, such as *constituer*, naturally prefer *de*. Passive constructions with *de* frequently occur with state verbs, which belong to different semantic classes. Additionally, verbs where the subject is an infinitive or a subordinate clause occur with de in the passive voice. With a nominal subject, the passive with *de* is a remnant of Classical French and is therefore very rare, affecting only 2% of cases [@abeille2021grande 216-218].

We are aware that introducing the *complément d'agent* as a predictor in our analysis introduces an additional source of variance. However, we have chosen to include it, as we believe it plays a crucial role in subject responsibility. Corpus studies on English passive constructions by @hundt_be-_2024 and @bohmann_large-scale_2023 suggest that the agentive prepositional phrase (*by*-phrase) reduces subject responsibility by introducing another entity that carries the agentive role. We believe the same may hold for French, where the *complément d'agent* could similarly influence the distribution of passive constructions.

We hypothesise that the *complément d'agent* influences the choice between *se faire* and *être* passives. The presence of a *complément d'agent* should favour *être* passives, as it introduces a responsible external argument and shifts responsibility away from the subject. In contrast, the absence of a *complément d'agent* is expected to favour *se faire* passives, which imply some degree of subject responsibility. **We expect phrases with de to have an even stronger effect than phrases with par, as they typically refer to less agentive or abstract sources, contradicting the dynamic nature of the se faire passive construction, which typically occurs with adversative or strongly agentive actions. To examine this, we will test the interaction between the complément d'agent and the verb cluster??, as we expect the se faire passive to be favoured by dynamic (and adversative) verbs (see \@seq-XXX).**

**Modal verbs** (auxiliary)

such as "devoir", "savoir", "pouvoir", "falloir", "vouloir" very frequent with se faire passive @novakova_construction_2009 \[9\] (in @raineri_analyse_2010 [97], reason: they denote "control" to the subject

-   modal category limited to/ only comprises modal verbs for the scope of our study, not other similar constructions denoting subject responsibility (e.g. avoir besoin de, arriver à, réussir à, envier de, avoir des difficultés pour, avoir la possibilité de, avoir envie de, ...)

Volitional verbs align well with [se faire]{.smallcaps} because they involve an intentional action that results in a change of mental state, whereas non-volitional verbs do not (source?).

### Aspectuality {#sec-aspectuality}

Regarding the factor of aspectuality, @keenan_passive_2007 [340] propose the following generalisation: "If a language has two or more basic passives they are likely to differ semantically with respect to the aspect ranges they cover." If we assume that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a "basic passive", this suggests that the *être* and [se faire]{.smallcaps} have different aspectual preferences. Aspectuality is expressed through the verb, either via inherent lexical semantics ("Aktionsart") or grammatical marking, such as tense, aspect, and mood [^1] [@kortmann_triad_1991 : 13].

[^1]: The general consensus in the literature is that aspect marks progressivity grammatically and Aktionsart marks it semantically/ lexically. However, this clear distinction between aspect and Aktionart has been doubted, and some theories see Aktionsart und Aspect as two instantiations of Aspectuality [@Dik+1997+217+246: 221].

<!-- We do not examine mood in this study.-->

Our overall predictions regarding aspectuality is a preponderance of [se faire]{.smallcaps} for hitting-touching verbs and progressive aspect.

**Semantic verb clusters**

[se faire]{.smallcaps} tends to occur with dynamic processes, particularly in contexts where the source role is agentive and the target role is affected, which is the typical case of semantic transitivity [@raineri_analyse_2010 90, 238]. Several hypotheses in the literature attempt to explain the compatibility of certain verbs with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. For example, @kupferman_construction_1995 \[67\] and @raineri_analyse_2010 [90] argue that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is compatible with dynamic verbs but not with state verbs or verbs of state change with an external "cause" argument. However, exceptions to this pattern are noted by @novakova_construction_2009 **pages?**, @martin_construction_2002 **pages?** and @raineri_analyse_2010 [100-103].

@martin_construction_2002 [14] challenges the notion that an external source always implies agency. She argues that a source can induce a change of state without intentionality and should therefore be classified as an "effector" rather than an agent. To support this claim, she contrasts two examples:

1.  

    a.  \**Je me suis fait étrangler par mon écharpe.\
        *'I was strangled by my scarf.'

    b.  *Isadora Duncan s'est fait étrangler par son écharpe qui s'est prise dans l'essieu de sa voiture.\
        *'Isadora Duncan was strangled by her scarf, which got caught in the axle of her car.'

While the first sentence is ungrammatical, the second is more acceptable, suggesting that the role of the source does not necessarily imply agency. @martin_construction_2002 also argues that [se faire]{.smallcaps} with psychological verbs, such as in *Elle s'est fait séduire par Pierre* 'She was seduced by Pierre', is not always causative but can have a passive reading. @novakova_construction_2009 also notes that, while rare, [se faire]{.smallcaps} can sometimes be interpreted passively with state verbs, as in *Il peine encore à se faire aimer par tous les siens* 'He still struggles to be loved by all his own'.

The semantic class of the verb has been shown to play a crucial role in the use of the passive voice in oral French [@da2022alternance] and in the alternation between [be]{.smallcaps} and [get]{.smallcaps} passives in English [@bohmann_large-scale_2023]. In the corpus study by @da2022alternance, **85%** of verbs in the *frapper* class ("hitting-touching" verbs describing violent actions) occurred in the passive voice, while only **15%** were used in the active voice. This aligns with findings from journalistic English, where verbs describing violent actions are frequently used in the passive voice [@henley1995syntax] **and Bohmann?**. According to @da2022alternance, this preference can be explained by two factors: (1) the topical character of the undergoer affected by a hitting-touching action, which makes it more likely to be promoted to subject position, and (2) the ability to omit an unknown or less salient agent, which relates with the concept of subject responsibility. We expect this effect to hold for [se faire]{.smallcaps} as well. Even though both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} topicalise the undergoer, [se faire]{.smallcaps} typically implies some degree of subject involvement. Consequently, highly dynamic verbs such as *frapper* might increase the likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}, where the subject is a more passive patient.

As shown in @fig-clusters, some verb clusters in the study by @da2022alternance did not show a strong preference for passive constructions, with active and passive forms appearing in approximately equal proportions (e.g. verbs of perception, cognition, psychological states, behaviour, movement and transfer). However, locative and communication verbs were more frequently used in the active voice. While this preference was not statistically significant for locative verbs, communication verbs showed a significantly higher tendency towards active constructions.

![**Frequency** of active and passive constructions for the verb clusters](images/clusters_dacunha-abeillé.png){#fig-clusters fig-align="center" width="470"}

@da2022alternance suggest that this pattern can be explained by the verbal disposition hypothesis by @stallings1998phrasal, according to which verbs show a preference for specific syntactic constructions that speakers store in their mental lexicon. communication verbs frequently occur with object complements, which rarely function as subjects. Since the active voice allows these verbs to maintain the object complement, they naturally favour active constructions over passive ones. @thuilier2012lemme makes a similar argument regarding communication verbs and postverbal complements. Additionally, communication verbs often feature an animate or human actor, which is more likely to be encoded as the subject in active constructions [@da2022alternance].

Hitting-touching verbs are dynamic and adversative, making them more likely to appear in passive constructions. Since these verbs emphasise the subject’s affectedness, they may be particularly compatible with [se faire,]{.smallcaps} where the subject typically is an affected undergoer. In contrast, with communication verbs, the subject is not necessarily affected in the same way. While the subject is involved in the communication event, it does not imply a significant change or affectivity, possibly making [se faire]{.smallcaps} less compatible with these verbs. communication verbs tend to favour the active voice due to their syntactic properties, particularly their frequent use of object complements. Additionally, as they typically feature a salient animate or human subject in the corresponding active construction, they may be less likely to occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. We therefore hypothesise that hitting-touching verbs favour [se faire,]{.smallcaps} while communication verbs favour [être]{.smallcaps}. We expect all other classes to not have a preference for either passive variant and group them together as "neutral". These include psychological, behavioral, movement, and transfer verbs. Their distribution between [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} may depend on additional contextual factors.

To test this hypothesis, we categorized the verbs according to their lexical class. Following @da2022alternance we used the verb cluster categories from the online version of the lexicon "Les Verbes Français" [@lvf], based on the work by @dubois1997verbes. @tbl-clusters in the appendix presents the French verb clusters defined by @francois_presentation_2007, on which this dictionary is based, along with language examples from our dataset. If there was no exact match, we used the closest similar class. In one case, *caillasser*, there was no entry in the lexicon: here we classified it as a hitting-touching verb, given its similarity to verbs like *attaquer*, *frapper*, or *bombarder*.

However, the effect of the verb cluster may interact with other factors, particularly animacy and adversativity. We also tested the interactions with these factors. We expect the animacy of the subject to have a stronger effect if the verb is from the "hitting-touching" or the "neutral" category. [se faire]{.smallcaps} could be strongly favoured with animate subjects compared to inanimate subjects, while this effect could be weaker with communication verbs, which could favour [être]{.smallcaps} regardless of animacy. The adversativity of the verb could favour [se faire]{.smallcaps} more in communication and neutral verbs than in hitting-touching verbs. While communication verbs may favour [être]{.smallcaps} and neutral verbs may not have a strong preference, adversative constructions may shift both toward [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Since hitting-touching verbs are inherently highly adversative, this factor is unlikely to strongly affect their passive preference.

**TAM**

The tense and aspect markings French cannot be clearly distinguished from each other because they heavily influence each other and depend on each other.

According to @raineri_analyse_2010 [365], the "type of process denoted by the verb" is a "necessary condition". inchoative/ durative aspect: "get passive and se faire passive focus on onset of the process that affects the subject referent, whereas be and être passive present the process in its entirety, without offering an internal perspective." ?

Tense, aspect, and mood are not entirely separable categories but are functionally interdependent. Tense can serve as an indicator of aspect in terms of how it sets the temporal focus of a sentence. Constructions in the passé composé tend to focus on the completed event, which could increase the likelihood of the *être* passive over the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive. In contrast, the imparfait, which emphasises the ongoing process, might favour the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive. In the present tense, we expect both passives to be evenly distributed, as the present tense emphasises neither the end point nor the process. Descriptions of future events tend to emphasise the beginning and ongoing process of an action rather than its end point (@bellec_construction_2014 [210]). We therefore expect that in the future tense, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is favoured over the *être* passive.

According to @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 \[141\] and @novakova_construction_2009, periphrases that denote progressivity, such as *être en train de* + INF, *venir de* + INF and *aller* + INF, occur more naturally with the *se faire* passive than with the *être* passive. This is because the *se faire* passive conveys a dynamic, ongoing action (Quelle) compared to the more stative *être* passive. (also: @bellec_construction_2014; @keenan_passive_2007 [341], @raineri_analyse_2010 [91]

We decide against coding tense, aspect and mood as separate factors, but consider them in the context of a functional category that reflects the difference between process focus (progressive) and result focus (non-progressive). Therefore, we establish a TAM-category with two levels: progressive and non-progressive. The descision to not keep the categories separately is based on findings by @bellec_construction_2014 \[210\] who argues that aspectuality and tense are closely intertwined and together are responsible for whether a sentence is understood to be progressive or non-progressive. This marking reflects the more functional nature of category distinction in French rather than the formal distinction in English for example. And even in English: @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [39]: "Form of auxiliary verb: present, preterite, perfect, infinitive, -ing" OR progressive/non-progressive) -\> only effect found by @bohmann_large-scale_2023 \[49\] that present and preterite disfavour get passive. @hundt_be-_2024 [97] does tag tense and aspect separately but later, in the interpretation, interpret them together in terms of a tam category (result: se faire favours progressive but non-significant effect).

(sentence for conditional marking: Subjonctif and conditional forms excluded because of CQL? Or: We mark them according to the tense they occur with)

Movement verbs also frequently occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps}, as noted by @raineri_analyse_2010 [90], who highlights the verbs *aller* and *venir* as examples. These verbs emphasize the initial phase of the process (*Spang-Hanssen 1967: 143*). Additionally, perception verbs, which imply a durative process, are also attested in *se faire* constructions (*Novakova 2008: 9*).

**levels**:

-   "progressive": imparfait, futur, periphrase constructions (called "progressive" but includes tense)

-   "non-progressive": passé composé, plus-que-parfait, present tense without periphrase construction

! & "**se faisant remplacer" -\> progressive form**

Progressive category: emphasises ongoing or continuous actions, includes the imparfait, futur (except for futur antérieur - "I will have..."), and periphrastic constructions like *être en train de* + INF, *venir de* + INF or *aller* + INF.

Non-progressive category: completed actions, includes the passé composé, plus-que-parfait, and the present tense without progressive constructions.

Our hypothesis is that progressive marking (whether through tense or periphrasis) favours the *se faire* passive, while non-progressive marking (e.g., passé composé, plus-que-parfait) favours the *être* passive.

<!-- ### Annotation Guidelines**Gender (masculin/ feminin/ mixed/ unknown)**-   Assign masculin or féminin if the gender is clearly marked grammatically:    -   Through a pronoun (il(s), elle(s))    -   Through an adjective or participle that marks gender (heureux/heureuse, content/contente)-   Use mixed only if:    -   The context clearly refers to a mixed-gender group (un groupe d’hommes et de femmes)    -   The grammatical form is not gendered, but the semantic context indicates mixed gender (nous referring explicitly to men and women)-   Assign unknown if:    -   No grammatical gender marking is present    -   For on, vous, je, and nous (if no grammatical marking appears)    -   For expletive subjects (il faut)**Progressivity (progressive/ non-progressive)**-   Assign "progressive" if:    -   The "se faire" construction is directly in the imparfait or future (except for futur antérieur) → indicates an ongoing or habitual action    -   The "se faire" construction is linked to an ongoing action, indicated by: A participe présent → Example: Ils acceptent de se faire endoctriner. → progressive/ gerondif + participe présent (en courant - while running)    -   periphrases e.g., être en train de (present continuous), aller + inf (futur proche), continuer à + Infinitif    -   adverbs/ Adverbial Phrases Indicating Ongoing Action: Temporal adverbs that imply duration or repetition: En ce moment (at the moment), Actuellement (currently), Toujours (always), Depuis (since), Encore (still)-   Assign "non-progressive" if:    -   passé composé, plus-que-parfait, présent, futur antérieur (...) - progressiveness is hinted at by another verb in the sentence (e.g., falloir or être) and not from the "se faire" construction itself-->

### Adversativity

The factor of adversativity is reflected in the semantics of the verb and captures the negative consequences of the described action for the subject. This factor has been shown to influence the choice between the English [be]{.smallcaps} and [get]{.smallcaps} passives [@chappell1980get; @hundt_be-_2024: 89, 96-97; @bohmann_large-scale_2023], with [get]{.smallcaps} being realised more often with adversative verbs than [be]{.smallcaps}. Since @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 and @raineri_analyse_2010 draw paralles between the [get]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive, an adversativity effect for [se faire]{.smallcaps} is likely.

@gaatone_desagreable_1983 argues that [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a strong "unpleasant sense" ('sens désagreable'), as it occurs mainly with verbs denoting unpleasant events [^2]. Although Kupferman [-@kupferman_construction_1995: 77] rejects this unpleasantness as a characteristic of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, he agrees that it is more commonly used in negative contexts than [être]{.smallcaps}. This is supported by corpus data: Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 110] found a clear preference for [se faire]{.smallcaps} to be realised with negative actions, with 30% of verbs in [se faire]{.smallcaps} denoting unpleasant events and only 5% denoting pleasant events. Also: @raineri_analyse_2010 [247].

[^2]: According to @gaatone_desagreable_1983, adversativity contradicts the notion of subject responsibility because subjects would not willingly bring such events upon themselves. According to him, the reason for this is the subject's involvement in [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions: if the subject experiences a pleasant event and this is expressed by se faire -\> mostly the subject has initiated the action -\> causative and not passive reading/ in contrast, it is less likely that the subject initiates an unpleasant action.

As @bohmann_large-scale_2023 note in their investigation of the [be]{.smallcaps}:[get]{.smallcaps} alternation, there are two hypotheses related to emotions of the verb: The adversativity hypothesis and the non-neutrality hypothesis. Both expect [get]{.smallcaps} to favour verbs with negative connotations, but only the non-neutrality hypothesis predicts [get]{.smallcaps} to correlate positively with positive emotion scores as well. Since positive emotion verbs have been shown to be quite rare with [se faire]{.smallcaps} [@novakova_construction_2009: 110], we have chosen to not test them. In their corpus study on the [be]{.smallcaps}:[get]{.smallcaps} alternation, @hundt_be-_2024 label this factor as binary as 'adversative' - 'non-adversative/neutral'. For practicality and clear statistical modelling, we follow them in our annotation and assign the tag 'adversative' if the event negatively affects the subject, and 'non-adversative' if the event is neutral or positive.

<!-- -   \@bohmann_large-scale_2023 [38, 43] Sentiment values of verb participles extracted from SentiWordNet: positivity, negativity, objectivity scores; reversed if sentence is negated -->

**Hypothesis:** [se faire]{.smallcaps} is preferred over [être]{.smallcaps} for verbs that denote "unpleasant" actions (as reflected by verbs labeled as *adversative*).

**Interaction:** Affectedness of the subject may be reflected by an interaction of subject animacy and verb adversativity: Negative consequences of actions, expressed by adversative verbs, affect animate subjects more than inanimate subjects.

# Data and methods {#sec-data-and-methods}

Prior to conducting our study, we preregistered its protocol on the platform AsPredicted (**Wharton Credibility Lab, University of Pennsylvania**) to enhance transparency and accountability [@huensch2024preregistration]. The preregistered study can be accessed here: <https://aspredicted.org/gp6y-dd8p.pdf>.

To maintain anonymity while ensuring transparency and consistency, we refer to ourselves as Annotator A and Annotator B when describing the manual steps.

## Data collection {#sec-data-collection}

### Corpus {#sec-corpus}

In our investigation of spoken French language, we aimed to select a corpus that authentically reflects natural language use. After careful consideration of available resources, we chose the French ParlaMint corpus version 2.1 [@11356/1431]. Although our preregistration document refers to version 2.0, this was a typographical error. Version 2.1 was the intended and only version available on SketchEngine at the time of data collection. As such, this does not represent a deviation from our planned methodology.

ParlaMint comprises French parliamentary debates from 2017 to 2020 and contains 38,702,395 tokens (32,214,147 words). We selected this corpus not only for its size and accessibility but also because it is well-documented, POS-tagged, and contains detailed metadata. We specifically chose a spoken-language corpus because [se faire]{.smallcaps} is known to occur more frequently in speech than in writing (**reference**).

The genre of parliamentary debates is somewhat specialised and our results may not fully generalise to all French spoken language. However, it still offers a wide topical range and a high level of linguistic diversity. **It has also been the subject of previous linguistic research (e.g., references).** As such, the ParlaMint corpus provides a valuable and representative cross-section of contemporary spoken French.

### Semi-automated approach {#sec-semi-automatic-approach}

To extract our sample, we used a semi-automatic approach combining CQL expression-based extraction and manual filtering. Our aim was to obtain an equal number of occurrences of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions.

First, we used a CQL expression to automatically extract a sample of 1,254 [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions from the French ParlaMint corpus [@11356/1431]. After this, Annotator A manually filtered the data to exclude false-positives, i.e. constructions that did not meet our predefined criteria for [se faire]{.smallcaps} passives (see @sec-filtering-criteria). During the filtering process, Annotator A also annotated the lemmas of the constructions and compiled a list. After filtering, the final sample consisted of 535 valid [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions.

```{r lemma-list, include=FALSE}

lemmas <- sefaire_sample |> 
  count(lemma)

```

Next, we extracted the [être]{.smallcaps} constructions using a CQL expression in SketchEngine. To filter the concordances, we used the list of lemmas derived from the [se faire]{.smallcaps} sample, ensuring comparability between the two construction types by controlling for verb-specific differences that might influence the results. Due to SketchEngine’s download limit, we retrieved the [être]{.smallcaps} constructions in four subsamples, each containing between 9,295 and 9,794 concordances. After downloading, all filtered instances were stored in a .csv file and merged into a single dataframe in R. To ensure reproducibility, we set a random seed using the function `set.seed()`, with the seed value derived from the lottery numbers on Wednesday, 12th March 2025, as listed on the official Lotto website ([https://www.lotto.de/lotto-6aus49/lottozahlen](#0)), with one digit removed to match the required length. We then randomly sampled a subset of concordance lines that was equal in size to the manually filtered [se faire]{.smallcaps} sample (i.e., 535 instances**, reduced to 532)**.

### Manual filtering exclusion criteria and borderline cases {#sec-filtering-criteria}

For our study of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} as a passive alternation, our main criterion was to include only those [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions that have a passive (and not an exclusively causative) reading, i.e. constructions that could be paraphrased with [être]{.smallcaps}. Consequently, we excluded expressions that could not be rephrased with [être]{.smallcaps}, either because the [être]{.smallcaps} construction was ungrammatical or the meaning was fundamentally altered.

We defined the following additional criteria, which follow from our main criterion:

-   **Transitivity of the verb**: the verb is a transitive verb (the direct object of the active sentence is the subject of the passive sentence). As described in @sec-etre, [être]{.smallcaps} requires a direct object in the active equivalent which becomes the subject in the passive voice. For reflexive and ditransitive verbs, [être]{.smallcaps} is not available and does not compete with [se faire]{.smallcaps}, which is why we excluded such constructions from our analysis. Additionally, we excluded impersonal passive constructions (*passif impersonnel*) due to the lack of a subject referent.

-   **Exclusion of fixed idiomatic expressions**: the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction is not a fixed idiomatic expression with a figurative meaning. We speficically excluded constructions classified as "idiomes lexicalisés" (lexicalized idioms) according to @raineri_analyse_2010\[163\]. These constructions neither carry a true causative nor passive meaning[^3] and cannot occur with a complément d'agent: *se faire entendre*, *se faire sentir*, *se faire attendre*, and *se faire désirer* [@raineri_analyse_2010: 163]. Examples of additional fixed idiomatic expressions that we filtered out include: *se faire passer pour* 'to impersonate sb.', *se faire avoir* 'to be fooled', *se faire mousser* 'to boast/brag', *se faire taper sur les doigts* 'to get a slap on the fingers, to be scolded'.

-   **Exclusion of adjectival constructions**: we excluded [être]{.smallcaps} constructions that are essentially adjectival constructions, such as *elle est connue* 'she is known'. Accordingly, [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions that would typically be rephrased with an adjectival [être]{.smallcaps} construction were also excluded.

[^3]: These verbs mainly occur with inanimate subjects (effects, consequences, discontent). @raineri_analyse_2010 [163-164] proposes that the causative meaning is not available for these verbs since the subject is not causing the event. There is also no passive meaning since they cannot cannot occur with a complément d’agent and do not have a paraphrase with être.

To ensure consistency and practicality, we decided to include or exclude verbs based on their lemma, rather than on individual occurrences. After manually evaluating all occurrences, the following lemmas were excluded from our sample: *entendre*, *sentir*, *ressentir*, *attendre*, *désirer*, *voir*, *connaître*, *passer (pour)*, *mousser*, *avoir*, *rouler (se faire rouler dans la farine)*, *mener (se faire mener par le bout du nez)*.

We also excluded imperative constructions because of their rarity in the passive and because of the semantic contradiction. While the passive focuses on the undergoer of an action, the imperative demands the performance of an action. We anticipated that imperatives would be unevenly distributed, potentially leading to statistical distortions.

Regarding tense, we chose to include all tenses in our analysis, including the present tense, based on previous literature suggesting that the present tense favours [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps} (see @sec-aspectuality). Tense is an important feature in our study, as part of the TAM factor. This approach contrasts with @da_cunha_lalternance_2020 and @da2022alternance, who focused exclusively on passive constructions in the compound past tense (*NP a été VP*) to prioritise verbal passives over adjectival passives, such as *La porte est ouverte* 'The door is open'. By including all tenses, we ensured that we did not exclude too many [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions and obtained a sufficient number of occurences for the analysis. This decision was therefore motivated both by the aim to capture the overall syntactic range of the passive alternation and by the importance of tense within the TAM factor. While we recognise that this approach increases complexity, we believe that it allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the [être]{.smallcaps}/[se faire]{.smallcaps} alternation.

A typical example of a [se faire]{.smallcaps} construcion that met our criteria is:

> (1) *Les élus se font très souvent insulter \[...\]\
>     *'The elected officials are often insulted \[...\]'

The corresponding [être]{.smallcaps} paraphrase would be:

> (1) *Les élus sont très souvent insultés.\
>     *'The elected officials are often insulted.'

In contrast, expressions such as *se faire connaître* were excluded. For example:

> (1) *Cette baisse est ensuite une conséquence de la crise économique de 2018 dont les effets se font connaître aujourd'hui.\
>     *'This decline is a consequence of the 2018 economic crisis, the effects of which are becoming known today.'

When paraphrased with [être]{.smallcaps}, the participle *connus* takes on an adjectival function:

> (1) *Les effets de la crise économique de* 2018 sont connus aujourd'hui.\
>     'The effects of the 2018 economic crisis are known today.'

However, our somewhat “fuzzy” definition of what constitutes a passive alternation, similar to the approach taken by [@bohmann_large-scale_2023], presented some challenges. While we excluded purely causative constructions, the distinction between causative and passive constructions was not always clear. The question arose: when is a construction semantically close enough to a passive alternation, and when does its meaning lean too much toward a causative interpretation? As expected, given the ongoing debate about the passive status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} (see @sec-debate) and the difficulties noted by [@bohmann_large-scale_2023] in their study of the English [be]{.smallcaps}/[get]{.smallcaps} passive alternation, we encountered a number of “unclear” cases during the manual filtering of constructions. We acknowledge that, similar to their study, there is no straightforward distinction between causative and passive readings, and some degree of subjectivity in categorization is unavoidable.

This approach is also supported by linguistic analyses that suggest a continuum between causative and passive meanings in constructions with *se faire* (see @sec-sefaire-context). The constructions may shift between passive and causative interpretations depending on the surrounding context. Their inherent flexibility suggests that a strict binary classification is inadequate, reinforcing the idea of a passive–causative continuum. This continuum can be understood in terms of the degree of agentivity of the subject referent. When its role is reduced to mere initiation of the event, the construction can be fully paraphrased with [être]{.smallcaps} without altering the overall meaning of the sentence. For example, *Il se fait remarquer par une patrouille de police* 'He is noticed by a police patrol' and *Il est remarqué par une patrouille de police* 'He is noticed by a police patrol' show an extensive equivalence between [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps}. Moreover, other elements in the co-text can weaken the causative strength and strengthen the passive effect, reflecting variable agentivity depending on the specific discourse context\[ @raineri_analyse_2010 154-160\].

We identified numerous cases where a clear binary distinction between passive and causative was not possible, for example when the subject is both the undergoer and the causer of the action. In general, we opted for a broad approach, including as many constructions as possible. This means that even when the causative reading appeared more natural (because the subject initiates the event), we included the construction as long as a passive understanding was also plausible (since the subject also undergoes the action). In doing so, we deviate from the more restrictive first criterion proposed by @bellec_construction_2014. Representative examples of such constructions in our sample include *se faire vacciner* 'to be/get vaccinated', *se faire élire* 'to be/get elected' or 'to stand for election', *se faire remarquer* 'to be/get noticed' or 'to draw attention to oneself'.

### Inter-rater agreement

We annotated the filtered sample for the features outlined in @sec-factors, in preparation for statistical modelling. A blind annotation process was used, where Annotator A and Annotator B were unaware of each other’s annotations. The inter-rater agreement was then calculated, as described in the following section.

As [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} data were collected separately, some steps were necessary before conducting analyses on the data. First, the data was cleaned by aligning the speaker and reference columns. Since annotator A annotated all complément d' agents of [se faire]{.smallcaps} during inital filtering, the column `agent_pp` was renamed to `agent_pp_A`. The datasets were then combined, variables were converted from characters to factors and empty values were replaced with `NA` to ensure proper handling of missing values in statistical analysis.

```{r read-annotated-data, include = FALSE}
sefaire_sample_annotated <- read.csv(file = here("data", "sefaire_sample_annotated.csv"))
etre_sample_annotated <- read.csv(file = here("data", "etre_sample_annotated.csv"))
```

```{r data-cleaning-colnames, include = FALSE}

```

Since the analysis required detailed (and time consuming) manual annotation, we decided to split the annotation work between us. However, to ensure consistent annotation, a representative sample of one third of all instances (320; 33,25%) were double annotated, i.e. by both of us. For these instances, we calculated Cohen's ϰ (Kappa) as a measure of inter-rater agreement, following Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 201] and the documentation in the psy package documentation (<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psy/psy.pdf>).)

We classified the ϰ-values using the influential benchmark categorisation of Landis and Koch [-@landis1977measurement: 165], who define an agreement of 0.81 - 1.00 as "Almost Perfect". Mean inter-rater agreement is high at `r  mean_kappa`. Agreement is lowest for the cateogories adversativity (0.67) and TAM (0.77).

### Data preprocessing {#sec-data-preprocessing}

For the main analysis, the combined data of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} data were merged into one data set where each column corresponds to one factor. This column includes the annotations of the first annotator (annotator A for half of the observations, annotator B for the other half).

```{r merge-to-main-dataset}
#| code-fold: true
#goal: one dataset with one column for each factor, the column includes the annotation of the "main" annotator
# special case agent pp column: if passive variant is se faire -> take value from column "agent pp_A", if passive variant is être is: same procedure as with the other variables
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_combined |> 
  mutate(
    subj_animacy = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ subj_animacy_A,
                             annotator == "B" ~ subj_animacy_B),
    subj_gender = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ subj_gender_A,
                            annotator == "B" ~subj_gender_B),
    agent_pp = case_when(passive_variant == "se faire" ~ agent_pp_A,
                         passive_variant == "être" ~ case_when(
                           annotator == "A" ~ agent_pp_A,
                           annotator == "B" ~ agent_pp_B)),
    modal = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ modal_A,
                      annotator == "B" ~ modal_B),
    tam = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ tam_A, 
                    annotator == "B" ~ tam_B),
    cluster = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ cluster_A, 
                        annotator == "B" ~ cluster_B),
    adversativity = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ adversativity_A, 
                               annotator == "B" ~ adversativity_B)
  )

# remove now-redundant A and B columns, remove ID (irrelevant since it's only there for être)
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean |> 
  dplyr::select(-subj_animacy_A, -subj_animacy_B, -subj_gender_A, -subj_gender_B, -agent_pp_A, -agent_pp_B, -modal_A, -modal_B, -tam_A, -tam_B, -cluster_A, -cluster_B, -adversativity_A, -adversativity_B, -ID)
```

The sample comprised 1064 observations: 532 for [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} each. Taking a look at the distribution among the categories to identify scarce combinations and patterns that could be problematic for analysis: <!-- create nicer looking table -->

```{r first-look-main-data, echo = FALSE}
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_gender)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$agent_pp)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$modal)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$tam)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$cluster)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$adversativity)
```

Some patterns are observed in the distribution of constructions: We see that the `subj_animacy` level "inanimate" has comparatively few occurences with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. The level "mixed" of `subject gender` appears infrequently overall and is excluded to prevent skewing of the analysis. The Complément d'agent "de" also is quite infrequent with [se faire]{.smallcaps} but is kept for now (may be excluded later if shown to negatively impact the analysis)

The level "unknown" appears much more often with [se faire]{.smallcaps} than with [être]{.smallcaps}, potentially revealing an annotation-related effect: When annotating gender, we took grammatical gender marking into account. Since [être]{.smallcaps} is realized with a participle that always agrees in gender with the subject, gender was always identifiable and only impersonal constructions were annotated as "unknown". In contrast, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is very common with infinitive constructions, which do not indicate gender. Therefore, when gender was not apparent from the context, it was assigned the label "unknown". We suspect that this creates an artifact because "unknown" is strongly correlated with infinitive constructions, and therefore with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. To test this, we create two separate data frames, one including unknown and one excluding unknown, which will be compared in the analysis. The data without "unknown" includes 503 [être]{.smallcaps} and 367 [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions.

```{r cleaning-main-data, include=FALSE}
# exclude "mixed" gender because of low frequency (would likely skew the data)
#sample with "unknown" kept
passive_sample_unknown <- passive_sample_clean|>
  filter(subj_gender != "mixed") |>
  droplevels()

# exclude "unknown" gender (needs to be reasoned and explained!)
# (merge "de" and "par" into a "present category")
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean|> 
  filter(subj_gender != "mixed") |> 
  filter(subj_gender != "unknown") |>
  droplevels()

# passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean |> 
#   mutate(agent_pp = case_when( #to merge par and de
#     agent_pp %in% c("par", "de") ~ "present",
#     TRUE ~ agent_pp
#   )) |> 
#   mutate(agent_pp = factor(agent_pp))

#check levels
levels(passive_sample_clean$subj_gender)
levels(passive_sample_unknown$subj_gender)

#check passive distribution without unknown
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant)

```

## Binomial logistic regression

In addition to conducting a descriptive analysis of the data, we employed a binomial logistic regression model to test our hypotheses. This method provides a logit value for each variable that "represents the chances of construction A to be chosen in a particular type of context compared with the chances of construction B to be used in the same type of context" [@levshina_how_2015: 253]. The model allowed us to exactly track the influence of factors and their interactions on the chances of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used over [être]{.smallcaps}.

### Levels {#sec-levels}

The levels are ordered alphabetically by default. We rearranged the reference levels to be most useful for both modelling and interpreting: Where possible, we chose the most standard case as a reference level (passive variant: être; complément d' agent: 0; modal: no; TAM: non-progressive, cluster: neutral). If this would negatively affect the stability of the model, the most frequent (subject animacy: animate, subject gender: masculine) or the most evenly distributed case (adversativity: adversative)

| Factors            | Label           | Levels                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|

| TAM                | tam             | non-progressive, progressive             |
| Cluster            | cluster         | neutral, communication, hitting-touching |
| Adversativity      | adversativity   | adversative, non-adversative             |

### Model selection

We fit a mixed-effects binomial logistic regression model in `R` following Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 253-276] and Gries [-@gries_statistics_2021: 393-452]. The model estimates the log of the odds that a given construction is realized with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. To account for individual variation, we include the verb `lemma` and the `speaker` (as indicated in the meta data of ParlaMint 2.1) as random effects.

We set a significance threshold p-value of 0.05 and apply backward stepwise selection [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Model quality was monitored and compared using the Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC), with preference given to the model with the lower AIC value [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Non-significant factors were removed one-by-one, starting with the one with the highest non-significant p-value [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Additionally, we evaluated model fit using R^2^, aiming to find the model with the highest possible value and therefore explains most of the variance. Note, however, that Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015] raises concern about the meaningfulness of R^2^ in logistic regression.

::: panel-tabset
#### Maximal model

First, we construct a model that included all the factors described in @sec-levels, the interactions we hypothesise to be significant, and the random effects of speaker and lemma. While the model does not include all theoretically possible interactions, it is considered maximal in the sense that it encompasses all factors and interactions identified in the literature review as potentially meaningful and contributing to passive choice.

$$
\begin{align*}
passiveVariant & \sim subjAnimacy + subjGender + agentPP + modal + tam + cluster \: + \\ & \qquad adversativity + subjAnimacy:gender + subjAnimacy:cluster \: + \\ & \qquad subjAnimacy:adversativity + cluster:adversativity \: + \\ 
& \qquad (1|lemma) + (1|speaker)
\end{align*}
$$

Although the main effect of `subj_gender` cannot be interpeted due to its participation in an interaction, it is striking that the odds ratio of `subj_gender[unknown]` is very high with a huge confidence interval of 10.49 – 124.99. The AIC is 771.3 with an R^2^ of 0.599 when excluding random effects and 0.748 when accounting for them. The vif-analysis reveals no high collinearity values for `subj_gender` or the interaction `subj_animacy:subj_gender`. However, as explained in @sec-data-preprocessing, we suspect an annotated-related artifact related to the level `unknown`. For that reason, we decide to compare the model to one fitted on the data set that excludes `unknown` constructions.

```{r max-model-unknown, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
final_model_unknown <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:subj_gender + subj_animacy:cluster + subj_animacy:adversativity + cluster:adversativity) + (1|speaker) + (1 | lemma),
    family = "binomial", 
    data = passive_sample_unknown,
    control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
  )

summary(final_model_unknown) # AIC: 759.3
```

```{r max-model-unknown-tab, echo = FALSE}
tab_model(final_model_unknown, show.aic = TRUE) # Marginal R2 / Conditional R2	0.701 / NA
```

**Collinearity**

```{r collinearity-model-unknown, echo = FALSE}
kable(vif(final_model_unknown))
```

#### Model without `unknown`

After excluding `unknown`, the model's AIC improves to 732.5. The model has an R^2^ of 0.46 / 0.67. Although this is lower than the model without `unknown`, and therefore explains less variance, overall, the model seems to make better (i.e. more stable and more precise) predictions. Since the variance explained by the random effects is larger than zero, the random effects must be kept. Due to its better performance, the data without `unknown` are used in future models.

```{r full-passive-glmer, output = FALSE}

#### Model without non-significant interactions

All non-significant interactions (`cluster:adversativity`, `subj_animacy:cluster`, `subj_animacy:subj_gender`) are removed, improving the AIC to 725.4 with an R^2^ of 0.450 / 0.664. Thus, without the interactions, model accuracy increases while the explained variance decreases slightly. With $p$-values \> 0.05, the categories `subj_gender`, `agent_pp`, `modal` and `tam` are found to be non-significant.

```{r model-back-1, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
model_back_1 <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:adversativity) + (1 | lemma) + (1 | speaker),

```

#### Final model

Non-significant fixed effects are removed step by step, starting with `tam`, which has the highest $p$-value. At each step, the main effect with the highest $p$-value is eliminated. The final model is reported here. Although `subj_gender` remains non-significant ($p$ \> 0.05), we retain it for theoretical and interpretative reasons. The AIC of 719.2 indicates that removing `agent_pp`, `modal` and `tam` improved the model quality while R^2^ stayed constant at 0.451 / 0.662.

```{r final-model, output = FALSE}

### Model diagnostics

**Residuals**

We check the residuals of the model using the `binnedplot()` function.

```{r residuals-diagnostics, include = FALSE}
predictions <- predict(final_model, type = "response", na.action = na.omit)
# plot(residuals(final_model) ~ predict(final_model))
library(arm)
# #Hosmer Leweshow Test
# install.packages("ResourceSelection")
# library(ResourceSelection)
# model_data <- model.frame(final_model)
# 
# # add predicted_probs hinzu
# model_data$predicted_probs <- fitted(final_model)
# 
# # create binary passive variant variable
# model_data$passive_binary <- ifelse(model_data$passive_variant == "se faire", 1, 0)
# 
# # Hosmer-Lemeshow-Test with 10 groups
# hoslem.test(model_data$passive_binary, model_data$predicted_probs, g = 10)
```

```{r residuals-diagnostics-binned, echo = FALSE}
binnedplot(predictions, residuals(final_model, type = "response"))
```

<!-- Binned plot: "The grey lines represent +- SE bands, which we would expect to contain about 95% of the observations. Desired: majority of the fitted values fall within the SE bands. -->

Following the recommendations of Gries [-@gries_statistics_2021: 445], we additionally use functions of the `DHARMa` package to create more detailed residuals plots/ to gain more detailed insight into the residuals structure. (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html)

```{r residuals-diagnostics-DHARMa, include = FALSE}
#install.packages("DHARMa")
library(DHARMa)
library(arm)
binnedplot(predict(final_model), residuals(final_model))
sim_res <- simulateResiduals(final_model)
plot(sim_res)
testDispersion(sim_res)
```

**Concordance index**

As Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 256] describes, the concordance index measures the ability of the model to discriminate correctly by providing the proportion of times when the model predicts the use of the variant correctly.

```{r concordance-index, echo = FALSE}
outcome <- as.numeric(na.omit(passive_sample_clean)$passive_variant) - 1

concordance_final_model <- Hmisc::somers2(predictions, outcome)["C"]
```

The model has a high concordance index of `r   round(concordance_final_model, 2)`. According to the scale reported in Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 259], this indicates "outstanding discrimination".

**Significance**

Additonally, we apply an overall significance test by comparing it to a model without predictors (i.e. null model) using an ANOVA [@gries_statistics_2021: 445-446].

```{r model2-significance, include = FALSE}
null_model <- glmer(passive_variant ~ 1 + (1 | lemma) + (1 | speaker), data = passive_sample_clean, family = binomial)

anova_final_model <- anova(final_model, null_model, test="Chisq")

#highly significant!
# ### model with unknown
# null_model <- glmer(passive_variant ~ 1 + (1|lemma), data = passive_sample_without_unknown, family = binomial)
# 
# anova(final_model_without_unknown, null_model, test="Chisq")
# #highly significant!!
# #relative likelihood
# (exp((AIC(null_model)-AIC(final_model_without_unknown))/2))
```

```{r anova-tab, include = FALSE}
# kbl(anova_final_model)
# #relative likelihood
# (exp((AIC(null_model)-AIC(final_model))/2))

rel_likelihood <- exp((AIC(null_model) - AIC(final_model)) / 2)

# ANOVA to data frame
anova_df <- as.data.frame(anova_final_model)
anova_final_model

# p-value
anova_df$`Pr(>Chisq)` <- format(anova_df$`Pr(>Chisq)`, scientific = TRUE, digits = 3)

# add relative likelihood
anova_df$`Relative Likelihood` <- c(NA, rel_likelihood)
```

```{r anova-kable-tab, echo = FALSE}
# kable table
kbl(anova_df, format = "html", digits = 3) |> 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover","condensed", "responsive")) |> 
  row_spec(2, bold = TRUE)
```

The ANOVA shows that our model is highly significant (LR-test=181.02, $p$ \<0.0001), indicating a strong improvement over the null model. The model has a vastly higher relative likelihood compared to the null model.

**Coefficients**

Looking at the log odds of the significant variables, it becomes apparent that communication verbs boost the chance of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used, while [être]{.smallcaps} is more likely in non-adversative contexts with inanimate subjects. (Although non-significant, feminine subjects are more likely to occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps} than masculine subjects.)

```{r coefficients-log-odds, echo = FALSE}
final_model_coef <- coefficients(summary(final_model))[,"Estimate"]
#"a negative coefficient expressed as a logit (or log odds) shows that this outcome is less probably than the reference level", positive -> more likely than reference level
kable(final_model_coef)
```

Odds Ratios:

```{r coefficients-odds, include=FALSE}
#convert from log odds to odds:
exp(final_model_coef)

#convert odds to probabilities
#exp(model_2_coef) / (1 + exp(model_2_coef))
```

The intercept of the final model is 2.78. This means that in the context of the reference levels (subject is animate and masculine, the cluster of the verb is neutral and the construction has an adversative sense), the chances of [se faire]{.smallcpas} being chosen are 2.78 times greater than [être]{.smallcaps}. The exact values of odds ratios are interpreted with regard to our hypothesies in @sec-results. \# Results {#sec-results}

Overall, two-thirds of the constructions have animate subjects (mode: animate; 704 vs. 360 inanimate). However, in *être* passives, inanimate subjects are more frequent than animate ones (195 animate, 332 inanimate; about 39% animate, 61% inaniamte), whereas *se faire* passives show a strong preference for animate subjects (341 animate, 26 inanimate - 93% animate, 7% inanimate), as shown in these plots:

       y = "Number of observations") +
  theme_bw()

mosaicplot(passive_variant ~ subj_animacy,
           data = passive_sample_clean)
```

The plot shows clearly that in *se faire* passives, the subject is animate in the great majority of cases. In contrast, for *être*, subject animacy is more evenly distributed, with a slight preference for inanimate subjects.

Frequencies for Passive Variants Gender and Animacy

As shown in @tbl-gender ...

       fill = "Subject Gender") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FC8D62", "#8DA0CB")) +
  theme_bw()

```

The barplots show that the *être* passive occurs most frequently with inanimate feminine subjects, while the *se faire* passive occurs most frequently with animate masculine subjects. This distribution supports the hypothesis that *se faire* is more frequent with animate male subjects than with animate female subjects.

For both passive variants, animate subjects are predominantly masculine, while inanimate subjects are more frequently feminine. However, the data for *se faire* with inanimate subjects is sparse.

For inanimate subjects, the difference in frequency between masculine and feminine gender is smaller compared to animate subjects, suggesting that the influence of gender on the choice of passive variant could be less strong for inanimate subjects than for animate ones.

```

As can be seen from the distribution of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} across different verb clusters in @tbl-cluster, neutral verbs are the most frequent category in both passive variants, making up `r   paste0(neutral_etre_rel * 100, "%")` of all [être]{.smallcaps} constructions and `r   paste0(neutral_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")` of all [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions. [se faire]{.smallcaps} is relatively more frequent with communication verbs (`r   paste0(communication_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")`) and hitting-touching verbs (`r   paste0(hittingtouching_sefaire_rel * 100, "%")`) compared to [être]{.smallcaps} (`r   paste0(communication_etre_rel * 100, "%")` and `r   paste0(hittingtouching_etre_rel * 100, "%")`).

Surprisingly, and contrary to our initial hypothesis, the only significant main effect in our model is the semantic verb cluster, with communication verbs favouring [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}. We had predicted that hitting-touching verbs would favour [se faire]{.smallcaps}, given their dynamic and adversative nature, while communication verbs would be more compatible with [être]{.smallcaps}, as they typically feature an animate subject and frequently occur with object complements. However, in our model, the odds of [se faire]{.smallcaps} occurring with communication verbs are `r   round(communication_odds_ratio, 2)` times higher than with verbs in the "neutral" category (CI: `r   paste0(round(ci_min, 2), " - ", round(ci_max, 2))`, $p$-value = `r   round(communication_pvalue, 3)`). In contrast, hitting-touching verbs, which we expected to strongly favour [se faire]{.smallcaps}, did not show a significant effect.

```{r cluster-predict, echo = FALSE}

neutral_predicted <- cluster_predicted |>

  pull(predicted)

hittingtouching_predicted <- cluster_predicted |>
  filter(x == "hitting-touching") |> 
  pull(predicted)

```

@fig-cluster-model-plot shows the predicted probabilities of [se faire]{.smallcaps} for each verb cluster, along with the confidence intervals. Note that these predictions are based on the context of animate subjects and adversative verbs, which are the reference levels in our model. For this reason, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is favoured over [être]{.smallcaps} for all three verb cluster categories. Communication verbs have the highest predicted probability of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, (`r   paste0(round(communication_predicted * 100, 2), "%")`). This supports our surprising finding that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is preferred for communication verbs, contrary to our hypothesis. Neutral verbs show a lower probability (`r   paste0(round(neutral_predicted * 100, 2), "%")`) suggesting a weaker preference for [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}. Hitting-touching verbs have a probability of (`r   paste0(round(hittingtouching_predicted * 100, 2), "%")`), but their confidence interval overlaps with that of neutral verbs, indicating no significant difference between these two categories. The wide confidence intervals, particularly for hitting-touching verbs, suggest a variability or uncertainty in the estimates, which aligns with the non-significant effect found for this category in our statistical model.

Predicted Probabilities of [se faire]{.smallcaps} Across the Verb Clusters
:::

Examining the most frequent communication verb lemmas in our data in @tbl-cluster-lemmas, we find that *insulter* (10 occurrences), *engueuler* (7 occurrences), and *représenter* (5 occurrences) appear most often with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Notably, *insulter* and *engueuler* are dynamic and adversative verbs, which may behave similarly to hitting-touching verbs, and typically occur with an animate undergoer - possibly explaining their preference for [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Conversely, the most frequent lemmas with [être]{.smallcaps} are *appeler*, *inscrire*, *rappeler*, and *représenter* (each with 4 occurences), which are annotated as non-adversative in our dataset, except for one occurence.

Frequencies of Lemmas in the Communication Verb Cluster for [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}
:::

Given this pattern, in line with our initial hypothesis one possible explanation is that adversativity influences the choice of [se faire]{.smallcaps} within the communication verb cluster. However, there was no significant interaction between the verb cluster and the adversativity factor.

As shown by the absolute frequencies of verb clusters across adversativity levels in @fig-interaction-adv-cluster, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is used more frequently with adversative communication verbs than with non-adversative communication verbs, while the opposite pattern can be observed for [être]{.smallcaps}. However, this trend is not strong enough to be statistically significant. @fig-interaction-adv-cluster also illustrates that neutral, non-adversative verbs are predominant with [être]{.smallcaps}, which reflects that [être]{.smallcaps} is the default passive variant.

Frequencies of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} by Verb Cluster and Adversativity
:::

Similarly to the adversativity of the verb, the animacy of the subject could play a role in the distribution of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} with communication verbs like *insulter* and *engueuler*, which typically occur with an animate undergoer. Again, a trend can be observed in the frequencies, but there is no significant interaction between the verb cluster and the animacy factors. @fig-interaction-anim-cluster shows the absolute frequencies of [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} across verb clusters and subject animacy. [être]{.smallcaps} is more frequent with communication verbs when the subject is inanimate, whereas [se faire]{.smallcaps} is more common with communication verbs when the subject is animate.

## Adversativity

Overall, non-adversative constructions occured more frequently than adversative constructions in our data, with a ratio of 69.08% to 30.92%. However, adversative constructions were more common with [se faire]{.smallcaps} than with [être]{.smallcaps}: While only about one fifth (22.66%) of [être]{.smallcaps} were adversative, this was the case for two fifths (42.23%) of [se faire]{.smallcaps}.

Regarding the interaction between subject animacy and adversativity, both adversative and non-adversative constructions with [se faire]{.smallcaps} were used more frequently with animate subjects, while [être]{.smallcaps} constructions were more common with inanimate subjects in non-adversative contexts.

```{r animacy-adversativity-plots, include = FALSE}
#| label: fig-animacy-adversativity
#Interaction Animacy: Adversativity:
ftable(passive_sample_clean$adversativity, passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy)

passive_sample_clean |> 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = subj_animacy, fill = adversativity)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ passive_variant) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
  labs(x = "Subject Animacy",
       y = "Number of Observations", 
       fill = "Adversativity" ) +
  theme_bw()
```

The logistic regression model revealed a significant interaction between subject animacy and adversativity with an odds ratio of 0.06 and a confidence interval of 0.02-0.2. This means that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is 0.06 times as likely as [être]{.smallcaps} when the subject is inanimate and the context is in non-adversative. In other words, in these contexts, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is used significantly less frequently than [être]{.smallcaps}. Conversely, since the categories are binary, this also implies that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is much more common in adversative contexts and with animate subjects than [être]{.smallcaps}.

```{r interaction-model-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: fig-animacy-adversativity-log

ggpredict(final_model, c("subj_animacy", "adversativity")) |> 
  plot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightblue", "orange")) +
  theme_bw()

ggpredict(final_model, c("adversativity", "subj_animacy")) |> 
  plot() +
  theme_bw()
```

As @fig-animacy-adversativity-log illustrates, animate subjects strongly favor [se faire]{.smallcaps} regardless of adversativity, with only a slight additional increase in its likelihood in adversative contexts. In contrast, the likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used with inanimate subjects increases significantly when the construction has an adversative meaning: [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} are almost equally likely for inanimate subjects in adversative contexts (40% likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps}) whereas in non-adversative contexts, [être]{.smallcaps} is almost exclusively used.

Even though an analysis of the most frequent lemmas shows that [se faire]{.smallcaps} most frequent verbs *insulter* and *engueuler* are adversative, there was no significant interaction effect of adversativity and cluster.

# Discussion

As the multifaceted and partly conflicting literature suggests, the passive is a complex and nuanced phenomenon. This entails some challenges for the systematic study of both passive alternations in general, and of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} specifically. Firstly, the variable context is necessarily broad due to [se faire]{.smallcaps}'s similarity to the structurally identical causative construction. As has been shown, several borderline cases can be interpreted as either causative or passive (sometimes even both) depending on the specific context. Similarly, [être]{.smallcaps} constructions range between the stative passive and the progressive passive, with the former sometimes being indistingushable from adjectival constructions. Decisions had to be made regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria; however, a different set of choices could have been equally justified and might have yielded different results. It could be valuable to examine the cases we excluded from our analysis to understand how they differ from genuine passive constructions. This would provide insight into the gray area where passive nuances are present, but no true alternation occurs, allowing for a closer examination of varying degrees of passivity.

-   Verbs like *insulter* (and *engueuler*, which is also frequent with *se faire*) are **colloquial and adversative**, making them more prone to occur with *se faire* rather than the more neutral *être*.
-   **verb cluster main effect; interaction with adversativity:** One possible explanation is that certain communication verbs, particularly those with an adversative nuance like *insulter* and *engueuler*, pattern similar to hitting-touching verbs, emphasising the subject’s affectedness. Alternatively, this could reflect a more general tendency for [se faire]{.smallcaps} to appear in contexts where the subject is undergoing an action with a certain intensity, which might be more common with communication verbs than initially assumed?
-   Regarding the animacy factor, initially, we expected the animacy of the subject to have a stronger effect if the verb is from the "hitting-touching" or the "neutral" category. [se faire]{.smallcaps} would be strongly favoured with animate subjects compared to inanimate subjects, while this effect would be weaker with communication verbs, which could favour [être]{.smallcaps} regardless of animacy.

With regard to our hypotheses, although few significant effects were found, the strong interaction of subject animacy and adversativity clearly shows that [se faire]{.smallcaps} predominently occurs with animate subjects and in adversative contexts. Subject animacy seems to be the main mediating factor: [se faire]{.smallcaps} is very likely for animate subjects in both adversative and non-adversative contexts while its likelihood decreases significantly for inanimate subjects. This is in line with the vast previous evidence on [se faire]{.smallcaps}'s preference for animate subjects [@koenig_semantic_1992; @novakova_construction_2009; @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967; @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987; @raineri_analyse_2010: 92]. However, our analysis challenge the claim by @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 and @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 that [se faire]{.smallcaps} strictly requires an animate subject: Our data provide evidence of inanimate subjects occuring with [se faire]{.smallcaps} (7%). Consequently, our model predicts that while [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a high chance to occur with animate subjects, it may also be found with inanimate subjects, particularly in adversative contexts.

However(, as @kupferman_construction_1995 argues,) even a strong correlation of animate subjects, adversative verbs and [se faire]{.smallcaps} does not necessarily imply that the subject is responsible for the event and brings negative consequences upon themselves. Instead, the increased likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} with inanimate subjects in adversative contexts compared to non-adversative contexts suggests that the construction emphasises subject affectedness more than [être]{.smallcaps}. \[Note, however, that inter-rater agreement was lowest for adversativity, suggesting some ambiguity regarding this factor, although it was still considered 'substantial'\]. Overall, we consider these findings to support the theory of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being preferred over canoncial [être]{.smallcaps} when marking subject affectedness.

The remaining factors used to test subject responsibility (subject gender, complement d'agent, modal) did not yield significant effects. This may be taken as further indication for... / this may further strenghthen an argument against subject responsibility and toward subject affectness// The absence of additional significant effects related to subject responsibility may further support this notion.

-   problematic category gender/ unknown; no real effect of gender - maybe tendency?

-   no effects of modal: summarising tense aspect and mood in a tam category of "progressivity" with strict classification of tenses (although sometimes not fitting in context) potentially problematic (but also needed to ensure inter-rater agreement and limited by the fact that neither of the authors is a native speaker of French) - overall labeling maybe not nuanced enough? The "modal" category in our study only includes modal verbs. Other similar constructions that express subject responsibility, such as *avoir besoin de*, *arriver à*, *réussir à*, *envier de*, *avoir des difficultés pour*, *avoir la possibilité de*, and *avoir envie de*, etc. could also be interesting to examine in future research.

-   regarding aspectuality

    -   cluster effect: communication with [se faire]{.smallcaps}; (also preferred with hitting-touching verbs but non-signficant)

    -   random effect of lemma accounts for a lot of the variance - agrees with Bohmann [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 48] who reports evidence that the English \[get\] passive, which has been shown to be similar to [se faire]{.smallcaps} in several regards, "is largely lexically conditioned"

One limitation of our study is that the predictions of our model do not directly reflect real-life language use, as [être]{.smallcaps} is far more common than [se faire]{.smallcaps}, which is comparatively rare (ratio in ParlaMint: 324,836 (38.300) être: 1,254 se faire). We created a balanced data set based on [se faire]{.smallcaps} lemmas to prevent our model from being dominated by frequency effects produced by extreme data unbalance.[^4] This approach allowed us to investigate the factors influencing passive choice and their complex interplay. However, it must be kept in mind that this ratio is artificial does not reflect the reality of passive use, in which [être]{.smallcaps} is chosen as the default in most contexts, and [se faire]{.smallcaps} remains a marked exception.

[^4]: Note that the ratio ended up not being exactly 50:50 because we had to exclude the gender "unknown" which removed 165 se faire and only 29 être constructions. However, this is is still much more balanced than the actual ratio.

A limitation of our study is that the lemmas were determined based on those occurring in *se faire* constructions, which may have influenced the analysis.

"Both the potential insights and the problems entailed by this approach are considerable." [@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 49]

-   interaction animacy x gender: *personne* (feminine) occurs frequently in the sample

(Telicity seems to be another important distinction: According to @bellec_construction_2014 \[209\], the *être* passive is likely to describe a result or mark an endpoint of an action, while the *se faire* passive is used for actions in progress and verbs that are in their nature ongoing (e.g. perception verbs, @bellec_construction_2014 [209]). This could be reflected in the telicity of the verb, with telic verbs preferring the *être* passive and atelic verbs favouring the *se faire* passive.)

-   implications for causativity debate?

Dataset/sample: problem: data are extremely unbalanced (ratio in ParlaMint être vs. se faire: ) -\\\> making the ratio 50: 50 would distort the reality significantly but if the ratio is kept the model will almost always predict êtrestrategy possibilities: - build a corpus where être is presented more than se faire but not as extreme (approximation, e.g. 40% se faire - 60% etre) ("over/undersampling within limits") - assign more weight to se faire constructions by "weights=" variable of glm function - \@bohmann_large-scale_2023 kept the imbalance (ca. 3 Mio be passive vs. 25 000 get passive) - evaluate with precision & recall, not just accuracy (F1-score)

As some linguists (e.g., Martin, Novakova / ... as above?) argue, *se faire* + infinitive can sometimes have a 'passive effect' even without a direct 1:1 alternation with *être*.

# Conclusion

-   Future studies: modality (spoken/written) as a factor (compare modalities), analyses on other modalities/varieties/registers

-   se faire passive more likely in informal settings, être passive more likely in formal settings

-   definiteness & pronominality of the subject

-   memory-based learning
