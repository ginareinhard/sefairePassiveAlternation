# Introduction

The French construction *se faire* + infinitive has evolved through analogy with the passive voice. Initially, it carried a causative meaning, where the subject had an active influence. However, in certain contexts, it can take on a purely passive interpretation, functioning as an alternative to the *être* passive construction.

What factors influence the "se faire" vs. "être" passive alternation in spoken French (specifically: parliamentary debates)? In other words: what factors influence speakers' choice between the "se faire" and the "être" passive construction?

In this study, we apply a quantitative, multivariate, probabilistic approach to statistically model corpus data.

# The French passive alternation of *être* and *se faire*

## Canonical passive with *être* {#sec-etre}

### Structure and meaning

The canonical passive with *être* in French inverts the syntactic functions of the arguments within a clause. The object of the active sentence, i.e. the undergoer, becomes the subject in the passive voice - a phenomenon known as diathesis. In French, the subject typically occupies the first position in a sentence. In the *être* passive construction, the undergoer is placed in this initial position, which results in topicalisation. This syntactic shift directs the focus away from the actor and onto the undergoer.

The French *être* passive construction consists of a form of the attributive verb *être* and the *participe passif* (passive participle), which is identical in form to the *participe passé* (past participle). Although other attributive verbs, such as *rester* and *sembler*, can also be used in passive constructions, they are less common. This term paper will focus specifically on the passive formed with *être*. In the passive construction, the subject of the active sentence becomes an adjunct phrase (*complément d'agent*), introduced by *par* or *de*, which can be omitted. The construction is referred to as *passif long* when a *complément d'agent* is present, and *passif court* when the agent is omitted [@abeille2021grande 210-211].

For example, in the following sentences from our sample from the French ParlaMint 2.1 corpus [@11356/1431], in 1.a the agent *nos concitoyens* appears in the *complément d'agent* introduced by *par*, while in 1.b the agent is omitted:

> (1) 
>
>     (a) *\[...\] ils sont élus par nos concitoyens au suffrage universel.*\
>         "\[...\] they are elected by our fellow citizens through universal suffrage."
>     (b) *Les députés sont élus pour contrôler votre action.*\
>         "The members of parliament are elected to monitor your actions."

An impersonal passive (*passif impersonnel*) is also possible in French. With impersonal passives, the direct object can remain as a complement, as in *Il sera acheté un livre* (‘A book will be bought’) [@abeille2021grande 210].

Some grammars distinguish between a *passif verbal*, with an event interpretation, and an *passif adjectival*, with a resultative interpretation. According to *La grande grammaire du français* [@abeille2021grande], this is about semantic differences, concerning the aspect of the situation. With a state verb, active and passive sentences are generally semantically equivalent (Tout le monde aime Marie. / Marie est aimée de tout de monde.). With an event verb, expressing a change of state or place, the passive describes a change in the initial situation or the result of this change. In the passé composé, the sentences *On a servi la biere* and *La bière a été servi* appear to be equivalent. In the present tense, on the other hand, or in the imperfect tense, the active phrase (On sert la bière) may describe a situation in progress, and the passive phrase a resulting state (La bière est servi). In the passive, the presence of an agent complement can favour the interpretation of an event, with a present tense of habit (La bière est servi par le patron). The passive court without an agent generally has the effect of presenting the situation without specifying the cause or the individual who is responsible. Its semantic focus lies on the action or the result of the action. [@abeille2021grande 219].

(The passive voice is relatively rare in French, accounting for only 5% of verbs in the French Treebank (FTB) (\@da_cunha_lalternance_2020), compared to 9% in English for the same text type (\@roland2007frequency). Overall, the passive voice is more frequently used in written French than in spoken French (\@da2022alternance). Approximately a quarter of passive constructions in the FTB are *passif long* (\@da_cunha_lalternance_2020), while in spoken French, this proportion drops to about 10% (source: Hamma). **-\> frequency in our corpus?**)

## [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive

```{=html}
<!--  Historical background

@bellec_grammaticalisation_2015 and @bellec_quand_2014 date the se faire + INF passive construction (PSF) to the middle of the 20th century and call it a "modern" construction that has since experienced a rapid increase in popularity. She describes a process of grammaticalisation and reanalysis for the PSF during/through which “se” has lost its reflexive meaning and “faire” has become an auxiliary. In merging, they form a “semi-auxiliary” and obtain a passive interpretation, while the causative meaning is lost (désémantisation). However, @bellec_construction_2014 claims that the causative reading did not disappear but instead coexists with the passive reading (debated, see below).

-   In contrast, @raineri_analyse_2010 [280-305] based on corpus data: sees origin much earlier, exists since origin of Middle French (14-17th century); NOT derived from causative reading, increased productivity from 19th century onward 
-   se faire passive "typologically marked", comparison to other Romance languages @koenig_semantic_1992 \[145\]; similar constructions exist in other Romance languages but passive reading only allowed in French @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 [236] -->
```

### Structure and meaning

The [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive construction provides an alternative way to express passive meaning in French: When constructing a passive sentence, the French speaker may choose to use [se faire]{.smallcaps} instead of the canonical [être]{.smallcaps}: The two constructions form a passive alternation. The [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive has been investigated by various scholars, such as @bellec_construction_2014, @gaatone_desagreable_1983, @koenig_semantic_1992, @kupferman_construction_1995, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013, @raineri_analyse_2010, @novakova_construction_2009, and @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987, to name a few.

The [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive construction consists of the pronoun *se* (which shows agreement with the subject), a form of the verb *faire* ('to do'), and a verb in the infinitive.

> 3.  *Des policiers se font agresser.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     'Police officers were/ have been attacked.'

Similar to the [être]{.smallcaps} passive, the direct object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. This subject is the affected experiencer of the action described (compare to example above). Unlike the être passive, however, the diathesis is not restricted to the direct object: [se faire]{.smallcaps} has "greater syntactic flexibility" [@raineri_analyse_2010: 93-95] and can also occur with ditransitive verbs, where the indirect object becomes the subject:

> 4.  *Les intéressés peuvent se faire expliquer tout ce qui touche aux retraites.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     'Interested parties can have everything related to pensions explained to them.'

The [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive also allows possessor constructions, where the subject of the passive corresponds to part of the object in the active sentence:

> 5.  
>
>     a.  *Le coiffeur coupe les cheveux de Pierres.* (Blanche-Benveniste 2007)\
>         'The hairdresser cuts Pierre's hair.'\
>     b.  *Pierre s'est fait couper les cheveux (par le coiffeur).*\
>         'Pierre had his hair cut (by the hairdresser).'

However, constructions like 5b. are especially controversial. Some scholars (e.g. Sveberg [-@sveberg_se_2012] ) argue that such instances of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are fundamentally causative rather than passive, since the subject both initiates and undergoes the action (as in: "Pierre made the hairdresser cut his hair"). This debate will be outlined in @sec-debate.

The semantic tension between the fundamentally causative nature of the verb *faire* and the passive reading has been subject to several discussions in the literature. Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 235] classifies the construction as “formally causative, but semantically passive”. The apparent contradiction has led scholars to question the nature of the construction, as Koenig and Pederson [-@koenig_semantic_1992: 145] put it: "how can a passive-like construction arise from a combination of a causative and a reflexive marker, where no marking of the passive function is apparent?".

Various answers to this question have been proposed: @kupferman_construction_1995 sees the causative and passive readings as homonyms with fundamentally different semantics and therefore assigns an inherent passive status to the se faire construction. This is in line with Bellec (@bellec_construction_2014, @bellec_quand_2014), who takes a diachronic approach: She describes a process of grammaticalisation and reanalysis for [se faire]{.smallcaps} through which “se” lost its reflexive meaning and “faire” became an auxiliary. According to her, [se faire]{.smallcaps} has been grammaticalised into a "semi-auxiliary" with components that are semantically non-transparent. She claims that the causative meaning has not disappeared but now coexists with the passive reading. Note, however, Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 280-305]'s corpus study, which suggests that the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive did not derive from the causative reading but evolved independently.

A syntactic approach is taken by Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 23], who suggests that the passive meaning is obtained by a mechanism that binds the empty NP-object position of the embedded verb to the subject via the reflexive particle "se". The subject is then interpreted as affected because it is linked to the missing object of the embedded verb (which would be affected in the active sentence but is absent on the surface in se faire) [^1].

[^1]: In the se faire passive, the embedded verb (i.e., the infinitive after faire) has an empty NP-object position since only the subject is realised. The reflexive clitic "se" binds the empty object position of the embedded verb. Therefore, "se" connects the (missing) object-NP and the surface subject (coindexation). In contrast to the être passive, the object does not become the new subject but is connected to the subject by "se". The subject is interpreted as affected because it is linked to the missing object of the embedded verb (which would be affected in the active sentence but is absent on the surface in se faire). For this to work, the embedded verb needs an agent as a subject (because otherwise, the missing object would not be affected).

These accounts offer only a brief glimpse into the analysis of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, which has intrigued scholars due to its distinctive nature: How does the passive reading emerge, and how does it differ from the syntactically identical causative reading? These questions remains controversial, and will be discussed in the following @sec-debate.

The following @sec-debate will explore the controversial issues surrounding the passive reading, including its distinction from the syntactically identical causative reading.

### Passive vs. Causative: The Debated Passive Status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} {#sec-debate}

The above-described stance taken by @bellec_construction_2014, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013, @koenig_semantic_1992 and @kupferman_construction_1995 that the PSF is a full-fledged passive construction is by no means undisputed. The opposing view - that the construction is a type of causative - is also widely represented in the literature.

It is most prominently presented by @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 and @gaatone_desagreable_1983, and has more recently been presented by @sveberg_se_2012. In their view, passive meaning emerges from verb semantics and pragmatics, not from the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction itself. They centre their argumentation around the notion that the subject of [se faire]{.smallcaps} "is always, even unconsciously, responsible for the occurrence of the embedded event." As Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 89] describes, there is also the possibility of a multitude of readings [@kokutani_sur_2005] and of a continuum between causative and passive (Hobak Haff 2000), eventually adapted by Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 154-166].

Koenig [-@koenig_semantic_1992: 143] points out that sentences including [se faire]{.smallcaps} can have both a passive and a causative sense. We find examples of this in the ParlaMint corpus:

> 6.  *Ce qui signifie que si nous ne le votons pas, nous **nous ferons taper** des deux côtés.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     'This means that if we don't vote for it, **we”ll be slammed** from both sides.'\
>     'This means that if we don't vote for it, **we'll make ourselves get slammed** from both sides.'

> 7.  *\[...\] il y a \[…\] des parlementaires qui **se sont fait élire** sur la promesse de ne pas supprimer 120 000 postes.* (ParlaMint corpus)\
>     '\[...\] there are \[…\] Members of Parliament who **were elected** on the promise not to cut 120,000 jobs.'\
>     '\[...\] there are \[…\] Members of Parliament who **made themselves be elected** on the promise not to cut 120,000 jobs.'

As Washio [-@washio_when_1993: 45] describes, the linguistic proximity of causativity and passivity is not exclusive for French but quite typical in cross-linguistic contexts, stating that "passive and causative senses are shown to share a basic conceptual structure" across the world's languages. Crucially, passive se faire and causative se faire are structurally identical, differing only in their semantics. According to Labelle [-@labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 236] the ambiguity is resolved by "the lexical items involved", that is, by the semantic nature of the three main components: subject referent, *se* and *faire*.

Referring to these three components, Bellec [-@bellec_construction_2014: 207] defines the following criteria for a causative reading, which distinguish the causative from the passive interpretation:

-   In the causative, the subject referent is agentive and has the role of both causer and patient. The subject actively initiates what happens to them. In the passive, the subject referent has only the role of the patient and is affected by the event.
-   In the causative reading, the particle *se* has a reflexive meaning whereas in the passive reading, *se* is not reflexive.
-   In the causative reading, *faire* has transparent causative meaning. This causative meaning is lost in the passive reading, where *faire* has no inherent meaning. <!-- add: how will we distinguish them / have we distinguished them in our study -->

Thus, causative and passive readings of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are distinguished mainly by the transparency of the lexical items, whether they are understood literally or as constructions without transparent meaning. Sometimes both readings are possible and the ambiguity cannot be resolved [@koenig_semantic_1992: 144]: Bellec [-@bellec_construction_2014: 206-207] suggests that this is especially the case when cognition and perception verbs are involved. Therefore, despite its productivity as a passive construction, Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 356-357] concludes that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is problematic because it does not fit into two distinct categoroes nor does it function as a single weak causative.

<!-- In the causative reading, "se" is understood as reflexive and "faire" as causative. In contrast, in the causative reading, if interpreted as a passive, the meanings of "se" and "faire" are not transparent. Thus, the subject referent does not necessarily cause the event and is not necessarily responsible (@koenig_semantic_1992\[143\]: "any notion of causation is absent"). -->

<!-- As @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 [15] explains: -->

This debate has been central to the investigation of the se faire constructions and cannot be left aside. However, even if the status of [se faire]{.smallcaps} has been the subject of disagreement and discussion, the literature clearly shows that there is a passive reading associated with this construction. This is independent of whether the passive sense emerges from within the construction or from the components it occurs with, or whether it has an underlying causative meaning. By comparing [se faire]{.smallcaps} and *être* constructions, and examining the factors contributing to the choice of one or the other, we may be able to shed light on this debate from a corpuslinguistic perspective. <!-- (-> exclude causative readings?). Can our findings contribute to the debate of whether se faire deserves passive-status? If not: no need to spell out the debate in detail. -->

## [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps}: Competition or Complementation?

### Defining the variable context

Both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} passives are available for the active diathesis [@novakova_construction_2009 : 108] and assign the role of the undergoer to the subject referent. @kupferman_construction_1995 sees the two constructions as semantically synonymous as they both convey a passive sense. Therefore, the two variants form an alternation and are expected to compete with each other in contexts where passive is to be expressed. We find that both variants may be used in one context:

> 8.  *Je remarque d' ailleurs que ce sont souvent ceux qui filment qui **se font éborgner** ou **sont blessés** par des tirs de LBD*. (ParlaMint)\
>     "Incidentally, I've noticed that it's often those filming who **get their eyes poked out** or **are injured** by LBD fire."

However, some scholars speak of semantic differences between the canonical être passive and [se faire]{.smallcaps}: As Novakova [-@novakova_construction_2009: 108] notes, the constructions differ in semantic nuances, as they have *un sens proche mais pas identique* ("a similar but not identical sense").

According to Raineri [-@raineri_analyse_2010: 87], the [se faire]{.smallcaps} is marked and predominantly used in informal contexts. In contrast to the canonical *être* passive, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is reported to prefer spoken language over written language. Additionally, [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a strongly figurative sense that être does not have: It is often used as part of idiomatic or lexicalised expressions [@raineri_analyse_2010: 165; @novakova_construction_2009: 117], and is associated with a "besoin d’expressivité and extravagance" ("a need of expressivity and extravagance") [@bellec_construction_2014: 206].

Previous research also suggests that se faire passive is more likely to have a causative undertone while the être passive is more neutral. As discussed in @sec-debate, it has been proposed that the constructions vary in their degree of passivity and that even within the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive, there exists a continuum between causatity and passivity [@raineri_analyse_2010: 154-166]. This demonstrates that the two passive variants are not semantically identical but rather potentially carry different meanings. These meanings may be more or less pronounced depending on the context. This potential semantic difference introduces certain difficulties in the contrastive analysis of the alternation.

The passive/causative continuum makes the definition of the variable context particularly challenging as some constructions may be more passive than others. Therefore, deciding where to draw the line between a passive and causative construction is a nuanced task. Bohmann et al. [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 35-36] face similar challenges when defining the variable context of the English be and get passive alternation.

Since our aim is to investigate the passive alternation of être and [se faire]{.smallcaps}, it is important to ensure that we only compare the être passive with real passive [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions, and not with causative constructions. We follow @raineri_analyse_2010 \[165\] in including only [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions that have a natural paraphrase with the *être* passive in order to investigate only constructions participating in the alternation. Agreeing with @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [35] who claim that "all extracted forms should be genuine instances of the variable under investigation" and that "only cases where both variants can be used interchangeably should be considered", we aim to exclude non-contrastive constructions, such as idioms and ditransitive verbs. We explain our criteria for excluding constructions in detail in section...

We recognize this "fuzzy" [@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 50] variable context as both a challenge and an opportunity: It is precisely these subtle differences that make the analysis interesting and our research valuable. Consequently, our study seeks to identify the exact factors influencing the choice between the two variants by statistically modeling real language data. Our central research question is: What factors determine the [se faire]{.smallcaps} vs. “être” passive alternation in spoken French, specifically in parliamentary debates? In other words: what factors influence speakers’ choice between these two constructions? In the following sections, we outline the factors we anticipate will shape this choice and present a hypothesis of passive preference for each.

<!-- être: exclude adjectives and some participles that do not form the passive (similar to @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [36])/ "instances that allow for gradation" @hundt_be-_2024 [92];; Maybe better in Borderline cases/ filtering criteria) -->

```{=html}
<!-- Several corpus studies on voice choice in French have shown that the choice between active and passive constructions (*être* passive) is not purely syntactic, but that semantic and pragmatic factors also play a crucial role in determining whether a passive construction is favoured.

-   Subjects in passive sentences are preferably animate, definite, and pronominal. In the study by @da_cunha_lalternance_2020, animate, definite, and pronominal arguments that function as the objects in active sentences were more frequently found in the passive (and vice versa). -\> prominence / informational structure as significant factor. (And: constituent length, shorter constituents are preferred in subject position and favour the passive voice) -->
```

### Subject responsibility

As indicated above, the question whether the referent of the subject in the [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction holds any responsibility is central to the debate of the construction's passive-status (see above; @sveberg_se_2012, @bellec_construction_2014 \[212-213\]). In line with their argument that the passive reading of [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a kind of causative, @gaatone_desagreable_1983 and @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 state that the subject referent of [se faire]{.smallcaps} is always a causer and therefore always responsible to some degree. This is contrasted to the être passive's subject referent, which is seen as more neutral. Gaatone [-@gaatone_desagreable_1983: 164] distinguishes between an "active patient" in [se faire]{.smallcaps} and a "passive patient" in the être passive [@raineri_analyse_2010: 96].

<!-- whether the passive reading of se faire is a type of the causative reading or its own instance -->

```{=html}
<!--  However, there is general consensus that
the PSF construction has a preference to mark the subject as an active participant (although according to @raineri_analyse_2010 [98] is is not "universally accepted" as some authors also name counterexamples @kupferman_construction_1995 [59].)
In @raineri_analyse_2010 [95]'s view, the idea that the PSF expresses subject responsibility is the "most common hypothesis" ("l'hypothèse la plus répandue") in the literature. -->
```

In contrast, Kupferman [-@kupferman_construction_1995: 59] gives [se faire]{.smallcaps} examples where the subject cannot be interpreted as responsible, one of which is repeated here:

> 9.  *Elle sanglotait parce que son tout jeune bébé venait de se faire enlever les amygdales.* [@kupferman_construction_1995: 59]\
>     "She sobbed because her little baby got operated on for tonsilitis."

According to him, subject responsibility emerges from the context and not from the inherently passive [se faire]{.smallcaps} construction [@kupferman_construction_1995: 98-99]. Further support for this idea comes from @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 and @washio_when_1993. For @martin_construction_2002, subject dynamism, but not subject intentionality, is a necessary condition [@raineri_analyse_2010: 90].

Thus, although the requirement of subject responsibility in [se faire]{.smallcaps} is not "universally accepted" [@raineri_analyse_2010: 98], ("une catégorie hétérogène complexe" (@raineri_analyse_2010 [249]), the analyses show some consensus in that [se faire]{.smallcaps} prefers to mark the subject as connected to the event [@raineri_analyse_2010], either through affectedness, responsibility or intentionality. We expect that his tendency is less pronounced for the être passive. In our study, we model subject responsibility by the factors subject animacy, subject gender, Complément d'agent, and modal verbs. Our overarching hypothesis is that [se faire]{.smallcaps} will be favoured over [être]{.smallcaps} in constructions with responsible subjects, indicated by animate, masculine subjects, the absence of complément d'agents and the presence of modal verbs.

**Subject Animacy**

Corpus studies have shown that animacy significantly influences voice choice in French. The animacy of the passive subject (not agent) has been shown to increase the likelihood of using the passive voice (*être* passive) over the active voice. @da_cunha_lalternance_2020 (+ @da2022alternance) -\> more explanation as to why

As implied in the debate on subject responsibility, subjects of [se faire]{.smallcaps} are predominantly active participants in the described action. Since inanimate subjects are rarely affected and even less often responsible, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is common with animate subjects. While some scholars claim that only animate subjects are possible with the [se faire]{.smallcaps}, others provide counterexamples [@labelle_anticausativizing_2013; @kokutani_sur_2005, @novakova_construction_2009: 4; @sveberg_se_2012] (@raineri_analyse_2010 [92]).

However, these examples appear to be exceptions as there are both corpus (@novakova_construction_2009 [111]) and experimental (@koenig_semantic_1992 \[151, 153\]) evidence that subject animacy and [se faire]{.smallcaps} are positively correlated: In @novakova_construction_2009 [111]'s corpus study, less than 3% of the [se faire]{.smallcaps} sentences had an inanimate subjects. In a survey by @koenig_semantic_1992, French native speakers rated the acceptability of [se faire]{.smallcaps} with animate subjects significantly higher than with inanimate subjects. Inanimate subjects were only allowed by some speakers when the subject "affects a relevant animate entity" (@koenig_semantic_1992 [151, 153]. The preponderance of animate subjects for [se faire]{.smallcaps} seems to be one of the few aspects on which scholars agree (@raineri_analyse_2010 [92]).

We tag animacy as binary "inanimate"/ "animate" although we recognize that animacy has been considered as a hierarchical scale in the literature, most prominently by @zaenen_animacy_2004. Following @zaenen_animacy_2004, organisations are understood as "collectivites of humans" and therefore annotated as "animate".

**Hypothesis**: Both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and *être* passive favour animate subjects over inanimate subjects but subject animacy is a stronger predictor of [se faire]{.smallcaps} than the être passive.

**Interaction**: @raineri_analyse_2010 [94] suspects that [se faire]{.smallcaps} restricts verb selection and provides an explanation for the construction's incompatibility with certain verbs. Therefore, we hypothesise that the choice of passive construction could be influenced not only by animacy or verb cluster alone, but by the combination of these two factors: For example, animacy could have a stronger effect if the verb is from the hitting-touching category or the neutral category ([se faire]{.smallcaps} could be strongly favoured with animate subjects compared to inanimate subjects), while this effect could be weaker with communication verbs for which “être” passive could be favoured regardless of animacy.

<!-- The preference of the se faire passive of animate over inanimate subjects is parallel to the English get passive (@hundt_be-_2024), although @raineri_analyse_2010 [92] finds that the get passive allows more inanimate subjects than the se faire passive. According to @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [43], the get passive has become more likely with inanimate subjects over time which may signify a lessening of subject responsibility. @raineri_analyse_2010 brings up the possibility that a similar process of grammaticalisation may be happening in French. (not sure if relevant)-->

**Gender**

Since previous research suggests that grammatical gender plays a role in voice choice, it is worth investigating whether this effect extends to the alternation between *être* and [se faire]{.smallcaps} passives.

@da_cunha_lalternance_2020 (+2022) found that in written French, a feminine agent increased the likelihood of *être* passives (in the passif court model, i.e. when the agent is omitted) over the active voice, with no interaction with animacy (whether the argument was human or non-human) \[or definiteness\]. This suggests that gender itself may directly influence voice choice. However, given the study’s small sample size, it is also possible that an interaction effect exists but was not statistically significant \[check 2022 study\].

Since we do not infer the agent from context in this study, our analysis focuses solely on the subject’s gender. If *se faire* passives favour subjects with high responsibility, salience or affectedness, the grammatical gender of the subject may influence the alternation between *se faire* and *être* passive. Specifically, if feminine referents are perceived as less active or agentive in certain contexts, a feminine subject may favour *être* passives over *se faire* passives.

To test this, we categorise gender into four levels: unknown, mixed, masculine, and feminine. Our hypothesis is that a feminine subject will favour the *être* passive and disfavor the *se faire* passive. We will test the potential interaction between gender and animacy, as the effect of grammatical gender may depend on whether the subject is animate or inanimate, potentially linking to the social gender of animate subject referents. Additionally, we will examine how unknown or mixed-gender subjects behave in terms of this alternation.

**Complément d'agent**

The *complément d'agent* introduces an external argument into the passive construction, typically referring to the causer or instigator of the action that is the driving force behind the event described. It is derived through diathesis from the subject of the corresponding active sentence (@sec-etre).

The *complément d'agent* is optional. It is usually formed with *par*, sometimes also with *de*, and even more rarely with *dans*. We do not consider the special case with *dans* in our analysis. In most cases, *de* alternates with *par*. The choice between *par* and *de* is not always interchangeable in meaning. For arguments introduced by *par* @kupferman_construction_1995 **(pages?)** postulates an "agentivity requirement", attributing strong responsibility to them. In contrast, *de* is generally associated with non-dynamic, static, or non-agentive interpretations. For instance, with the verb accompagner, a *complément d’agent* with par implies a more active role of the argument than with *de*. Some verbs, such as *constituer*, naturally prefer *de*. Passive constructions with *de* frequently occur with state verbs, which belong to different semantic classes. Additionally, verbs where the subject is an infinitive or a subordinate clause occur with de in the passive voice. With a nominal subject, the passive with *de* is a remnant of Classical French and is therefore very rare, affecting only 2% of cases [@abeille2021grande 216-218].

We are aware that introducing the *complément d'agent* as a predictor in our analysis introduces an additional source of variance. However, we have chosen to include it, as we believe it plays a crucial role in subject responsibility. Corpus studies on English passive constructions by @hundt_be-_2024 and @bohmann_large-scale_2023 suggest that the agentive prepositional phrase (*by*-phrase) reduces subject responsibility by introducing another entity that carries the agentive role. We believe the same may hold for French, where the *complément d'agent* could similarly influence the distribution of passive constructions.

We hypothesise that the *complément d'agent* influences the choice between *se faire* and *être* passives. The presence of a *complément d'agent* should favour *être* passives, as it introduces a responsible external argument and shifts responsibility away from the subject. In contrast, the absence of a *complément d'agent* is expected to favour *se faire* passives, which imply some degree of subject responsibility. **We expect phrases with de to have an even stronger effect than phrases with par, as they typically refer to less agentive or abstract sources, contradicting the dynamic nature of the se faire passive construction, which typically occurs with adversative or strongly agentive actions. To examine this, we will test the interaction between the complément d'agent and the verb cluster??, as we expect the se faire passive to be favoured by dynamic (and adversative) verbs (see \@seq-XXX).**

**Modal verbs** (auxiliary)

such as "devoir", "savoir", "pouvoir", "falloir", "vouloir" very frequent with se faire passive @novakova_construction_2009 \[9\] (in @raineri_analyse_2010 [97], reason: they denote "control" to the subject

-   modal category limited to/ only comprises modal verbs for the scope of our study, not other similar constructions denoting subject responsibility (e.g. avoir besoin de, arriver à, réussir à, envier de, avoir des difficultés pour, avoir la possibilité de, avoir envie de, ...)

Volitional verbs align well with [se faire]{.smallcaps} because they involve an intentional action that results in a change of mental state, whereas non-volitional verbs do not (source?).

### Aspectuality

Regarding the factor of aspectuality, @keenan_passive_2007 [340] propose the following generalisation: "If a language has two or more basic passives they are likely to differ semantically with respect to the aspect ranges they cover." If we assume that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is a "basic passive", this suggests that the *être* and [se faire]{.smallcaps} have different aspectual preferences. Aspectuality is expressed through the verb, either via inherent lexical semantics ("Aktionsart") or grammatical marking, such as tense, aspect, and mood [^2] [@kortmann_triad_1991 : 13].

[^2]: The general consensus in the literature is that aspect marks progressivity grammatically and Aktionsart marks it semantically/ lexically. However, this clear distinction between aspect and Aktionart has been doubted, and some theories see Aktionsart und Aspect as two instantiations of Aspectuality [@Dik+1997+217+246: 221].

<!-- We do not examine mood in this study.-->

Our overall predictions regarding aspectuality is a preponderance of [se faire]{.smallcaps} for hitting-touching verbs and progressive aspect.

**Semantic verb clusters**

[se faire]{.smallcaps} tends to occur with dynamic processes, particularly in contexts where the source role is agentive and the target role is affected, which is the typical case of semantic transitivity [@raineri_analyse_2010 90, 238]. Several hypotheses in the literature attempt to explain the compatibility of certain verbs with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. For example, @kupferman_construction_1995 \[67\] and @raineri_analyse_2010 [90] argue that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is compatible with dynamic verbs but not with state verbs or verbs of state change with an external "cause" argument. However, exceptions to this pattern are noted by @novakova_construction_2009 **pages?**, @martin_construction_2002 **pages?** and @raineri_analyse_2010 [100-103].

@martin_construction_2002 [14] challenges the notion that an external source always implies agency. She argues that a source can induce a change of state without intentionality and should therefore be classified as an "effector" rather than an agent. To support this claim, she contrasts two examples:

1.  

    a.  \**Je me suis fait étrangler par mon écharpe.\
        *'I was strangled by my scarf.'

    b.  *Isadora Duncan s'est fait étrangler par son écharpe qui s'est prise dans l'essieu de sa voiture.\
        *'Isadora Duncan was strangled by her scarf, which got caught in the axle of her car.'

While the first sentence is ungrammatical, the second is more acceptable, suggesting that the role of the source does not necessarily imply agency. @martin_construction_2002 also argues that [se faire]{.smallcaps} with psychological verbs, such as in *Elle s'est fait séduire par Pierre* 'She was seduced by Pierre', is not always causative but can have a passive reading. @novakova_construction_2009 also notes that, while rare, [se faire]{.smallcaps} can sometimes be interpreted passively with state verbs, as in *Il peine encore à se faire aimer par tous les siens* 'He still struggles to be loved by all his own'.

The semantic class of the verb has been shown to play a crucial role in the use of the passive voice in oral French [@da2022alternance] and in the alternation between [be]{.smallcaps} and [get]{.smallcaps} passives in English [@bohmann_large-scale_2023]. In the corpus study by @da2022alternance, **85%** of verbs in the *frapper* class ("hitting-touching" verbs describing violent actions) occurred in the passive voice, while only **15%** were used in the active voice. This aligns with findings from journalistic English, where verbs describing violent actions are frequently used in the passive voice [@henley1995syntax] **and Bohmann?**. According to @da2022alternance, this preference can be explained by two factors: (1) the topical character of the undergoer affected by a hitting-touching action, which makes it more likely to be promoted to subject position, and (2) the ability to omit an unknown or less salient agent, which relates with the concept of subject responsibility. We expect this effect to hold for [se faire]{.smallcaps} as well. Even though both [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} topicalise the undergoer, [se faire]{.smallcaps} typically implies some degree of subject involvement. Consequently, highly dynamic verbs such as *frapper* might increase the likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}, where the subject is a more passive patient.

As shown in @fig-clusters, some verb clusters in the study by @da2022alternance did not show a strong preference for passive constructions, with active and passive forms appearing in approximately equal proportions (e.g. verbs of perception, cognition, psychological states, behaviour, movement and transfer). However, locative and communication verbs were more frequently used in the active voice. While this preference was not statistically significant for locative verbs, communication verbs showed a significantly higher tendency towards active constructions.

![**Frequency** of active and passive constructions for the verb clusters](images/clusters_dacunha-abeillé.png){#fig-clusters fig-align="center" width="470"}

@da2022alternance suggest that this pattern can be explained by the verbal disposition hypothesis by @stallings1998phrasal, according to which verbs show a preference for specific syntactic constructions that speakers store in their mental lexicon. communication verbs frequently occur with object complements, which rarely function as subjects. Since the active voice allows these verbs to maintain the object complement, they naturally favour active constructions over passive ones. @thuilier2012lemme makes a similar argument regarding communication verbs and postverbal complements. Additionally, communication verbs often feature an animate or human actor, which is more likely to be encoded as the subject in active constructions [@da2022alternance].

Hitting-touching verbs are dynamic and adversative, making them more likely to appear in passive constructions. Since these verbs emphasise the subject’s affectedness, they may be particularly compatible with [se faire,]{.smallcaps} where the subject typically is an affected undergoer. In contrast, with communication verbs, the subject is not necessarily affected in the same way. While the subject is involved in the communication event, it does not imply a significant change or affectivity, possibly making [se faire]{.smallcaps} less compatible with these verbs. communication verbs tend to favour the active voice due to their syntactic properties, particularly their frequent use of object complements. Additionally, as they typically feature a salient animate or human subject in the corresponding active construction, they may be less likely to occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. We therefore hypothesise that hitting-touching verbs favour [se faire,]{.smallcaps} while communication verbs favour [être]{.smallcaps}. We expect all other classes to not have a preference for either passive variant and group them together as "neutral". These include psychological, behavioral, movement, and transfer verbs. Their distribution between [être]{.smallcaps} and [se faire]{.smallcaps} may depend on additional contextual factors.

To test this hypothesis, we categorised the verbs based on their lexical class, using the verb cluster categories from the lexicon "Les Verbes Français - LVF" [@lvf], following @da2022alternance. **TableX** in the @appendix presents the French verb clusters defined by @francois_presentation_2007, on which this dictionary is based, along with language examples from our dataset. If there was no exact match, we used the closest similar class. In one case, *caillasser*, there was no entry in the lexicon: here we classified it as a hitting-touching verb, given its similarity to verbs like *attaquer*, *frapper*, or *bombarder*.

However, the effect of the verb cluster may interact with other factors, particularly animacy and adversativity. We also tested the interactions with these factors. We expect the animacy of the subject to have a stronger effect if the verb is from the "hitting-touching" or the "neutral" category. [se faire]{.smallcaps} could be strongly favoured with animate subjects compared to inanimate subjects, while this effect could be weaker with communication verbs, which could favour [être]{.smallcaps} regardless of animacy. The adversativity of the verb could favour [se faire]{.smallcaps} more in communication and neutral verbs than in hitting-touching verbs. While communication verbs may favour [être]{.smallcaps} and neutral verbs may not have a strong preference, adversative constructions may shift both toward [se faire]{.smallcaps}. Since hitting-touching verbs are inherently highly adversative, this factor is unlikely to strongly affect their passive preference.

**TAM**

The tense and aspect markings French cannot be clearly distinguished from each other because they heavily influence each other and depend on each other.

According to @raineri_analyse_2010 [365], the "type of process denoted by the verb" is a "necessary condition". inchoative/ durative aspect: "get passive and se faire passive focus on onset of the process that affects the subject referent, whereas be and être passive present the process in its entirety, without offering an internal perspective." ?

Tense, aspect, and mood are not entirely separable categories but are functionally interdependent. Tense can serve as an indicator of aspect in terms of how it sets the temporal focus of a sentence. Constructions in the passé composé tend to focus on the completed event, which could increase the likelihood of the *être* passive over the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive. In contrast, the imparfait, which emphasises the ongoing process, might favour the [se faire]{.smallcaps} passive. In the present tense, we expect both passives to be evenly distributed, as the present tense emphasises neither the end point nor the process. Descriptions of future events tend to emphasise the beginning and ongoing process of an action rather than its end point (@bellec_construction_2014 [210]). We therefore expect that in the future tense, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is favoured over the *être* passive.

According to @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 \[141\] and @novakova_construction_2009, periphrases that denote progressivity, such as *être en train de* + INF, *venir de* + INF and *aller* + INF, occur more naturally with the *se faire* passive than with the *être* passive. This is because the *se faire* passive conveys a dynamic, ongoing action (Quelle) compared to the more stative *être* passive. (also: @bellec_construction_2014; @keenan_passive_2007 [341], @raineri_analyse_2010 [91]

We decide against coding tense, aspect and mood as separate factors, but consider them in the context of a functional category that reflects the difference between process focus (progressive) and result focus (non-progressive). Therefore, we establish a TAM-category with two levels: progressive and non-progressive. The descision to not keep the categories separately is based on findings by @bellec_construction_2014 \[210\] who argues that aspectuality and tense are closely intertwined and together are responsible for whether a sentence is understood to be progressive or non-progressive. This marking reflects the more functional nature of category distinction in French rather than the formal distinction in English for example. And even in English: @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [39]: "Form of auxiliary verb: present, preterite, perfect, infinitive, -ing" OR progressive/non-progressive) -\> only effect found by @bohmann_large-scale_2023 \[49\] that present and preterite disfavour get passive. @hundt_be-_2024 [97] does tag tense and aspect separately but later, in the interpretation, interpret them together in terms of a tam category (result: se faire favours progressive but non-significant effect).

(sentence for conditional marking: Subjonctif and conditional forms excluded because of CQL? Or: We mark them according to the tense they occur with)

Movement verbs also frequently occur with [se faire]{.smallcaps}, as noted by @raineri_analyse_2010 [90], who highlights the verbs *aller* and *venir* as examples. These verbs emphasize the initial phase of the process (*Spang-Hanssen 1967: 143*). Additionally, perception verbs, which imply a durative process, are also attested in *se faire* constructions (*Novakova 2008: 9*).

**levels**:

-   "progressive": imparfait, futur, periphrase constructions (called "progressive" but includes tense)

-   "non-progressive": passé composé, plus-que-parfait, present tense without periphrase construction

! & "**se faisant remplacer" -\> progressive form**

Progressive category: emphasises ongoing or continuous actions, includes the imparfait, futur (except for futur antérieur - "I will have..."), and periphrastic constructions like *être en train de* + INF, *venir de* + INF or *aller* + INF.

Non-progressive category: completed actions, includes the passé composé, plus-que-parfait, and the present tense without progressive constructions.

Our hypothesis is that progressive marking (whether through tense or periphrasis) favours the *se faire* passive, while non-progressive marking (e.g., passé composé, plus-que-parfait) favours the *être* passive.

### Adversativity

The factor of "Adversativity" is reflected in the semantics of the verb and captures the (negative) consequences of the described action for the subject. It has been found to be relevant to the choice between the English be and get passive [@chappell1980get; @hundt_be-_2024: 89, 96-97; @bohmann_large-scale_2023], with the get passive being realized more often with adversative verbs than the be passive. @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 and @raineri_analyse_2010 draw parallels between the English get passive and French [se faire]{.smallcaps}.

@gaatone_desagreable_1983 argues that [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a strong "unpleasant sense" ("sens désagreable") because it occurs mainly with verbs denoting unpleasant events [^3]. Although Kupferman [-@kupferman_construction_1995: 77] rejects the "unpleasant sense" as a characteristic of [se faire]{.smallcaps}, he agrees that it is more commonly used in unpleasant contexts than être. This is supported by corpus data: @novakova_construction_2009 \[110\] found a clear preference for [se faire]{.smallcaps} to be realised with unpleasant actions, with 30% of verbs in [se faire]{.smallcaps} denoting unpleasant events and only 5% denoting pleasant events. Also: @raineri_analyse_2010 [247].

[^3]: According to @gaatone_desagreable_1983, unpleasant events contradict the notion of subject responsibility because subjects would not willingly bring the unpleasant event upon themselves. According to him, the reason this is the subject's involvement in se faire constructions: if the subject experiences a pleasant event and this is expressed by se faire -\> mostly the subject has initiated the action -\> causative and not passive reading (language example?)/ in contrast, it is less likely that the subject initiates an unpleasant action.

As @bohmann_large-scale_2023 notes in their investigation of the be/get alternation there are two hypotheses related to emotions of the verb: The adversativity hypothesis and the non-neutrality hypothesis. Both expect the *get* passive to favour verbs with negative scores; but only the non-neutrality hypothesis predicts get passive to correlate positively with positive emotion scores as well. Since positive emotion verbs have been shown to be quite rare with [se faire]{.smallcaps} (@novakova_construction_2009 [110]) we have chosen to not test them and label them as "neutral".

In their corpus study on the English be: get passive alternation, @hundt_be-_2024 label this factor as binary on the verb as adversative, non-adversative/neutral. For practicality and clear statistical modelling, we follow them in our annotation: "Adversative" if event negatively affects the subject, "non-adversative" if event is neutral or positive.

<!-- -   \@bohmann_large-scale_2023 [38, 43] Sentiment values of verb participles extracted from SentiWordNet: positivity, negativity, objectivity scores; reversed if sentence is negated -->

**Hypothesis:** [se faire]{.smallcaps} is preferred over the *être* passive for verbs that denote "unpleasant" actions (as reflected by verbs labeled as "adversative").

**Interaction:** Affectedness of the subject may be reflected by an interaction of subject animacy and verb adversativity: Negative consequences of actions, expressed by adversative verbs, affect animate subjects more than inanimate subjects.

# Data and Methods

Prior to conducting our study, we preregistered its protocol on the platform "AsPredicted" (**Wharton Credibility Lab, University of Pennsylvania**) to enhance transparency and accountability [@huensch2024preregistration]. The preregistered study can be accessed here: <https://aspredicted.org/gp6y-dd8p.pdf>.

## Data Collection

### Corpus

In our investigation of spoken French language, we aimed to select a corpus that represents authentic French spoken language. After thorough consideration and exploration of our options, we decided for the French ParlaMint corpus 2.1 [@11356/1431] **(explain why different version than specified in preregistration)**. ParlaMint consists of French parliamentary debates from 2017 to 2020 and contains 38,702,395 tokens (32,214,147 words). We chose this corpus because it is well-documented, POS-tagged and contains rich meta data.

We recognize that the genre of parliamentary debates is quite specialised and our results therefore cannot be generalized to all French spoken language. However, the language of parliamentary debates is a fascinating genre in itself (studied before: references) and is expected to reflect a wide range of topics, thus providing a cross-section of language varieties as they occur in French speech.

We extracted the concordances from the French ParlaMint corpus [@11356/1431] using a CQL expression in SketchEngine. To extract the data we chose a semi-automatic approach that included manual filtering.

-   We selected an equal number of occurrences of *être* passive and *se faire* passive.
    -   We made a list of the lemmas in the se faire constructions → used these lemmas to filter the être constructions

    -   Exclusion of causative reading of se faire constructions: the same verbs have been used with être passive in the same corpus (find/extract the constructions) → depends on how many constructions we have left
-   We have not taken into account impersonal passives (*example from corpus*)
-   être passive: In their active/passive alternation study @da_cunha_lalternance_2020 only chose passive sentences in the compound past tense "NP a été VP" in order to favour verbal passives over adjectival passives (*La porte est ouverte*). However, we chose to include the present tense/all tenses. This decision was based on previous literature suggesting that the present tense favors *se faire* passive over *être* passive, making tense an important factor in our study.
-   In line with @da_cunha_lalternance_2020 we chose complément d'agents introduced by the preposition *par*, avoiding additional variation caused by *de*.

```{=html}
<!-- problem: data are extremely unbalanced (ratio in ParlaMint être vs. se faire: ) -\> making the ratio 50: 50 would distort the reality significantly but if the ratio is kept the model will almost always predict être
strategy possibilities:
    -   build a corpus where être is presented more than se faire but not as extreme (approximation, e.g. 40% se faire - 60% etre) ("over/undersampling within limits")
    -   assign more weight to se faire constructions by "weights=" variable of glm function
    -   @bohmann_large-scale_2023 kept the imbalance (ca. 3 Mio be passive vs. 25 000 get passive)
    -   evaluate with precision & recall, not just accuracy (F1-score) -->
```

```{r lemma-list, include=FALSE}

lemmas <- sefaire_sample |> 
  count(lemma)

```

### Semi-automated approach

As the data are very unbalanced, we took some steps in the data collection process to minimise bias and ensure reproducibility:

**se faire passive**

We automatically extracted a sample of 1,254 *se faire* + infinitive constructions from the ParlaMint 2.0 corpus on Sketch Engine \[source?\] using a CQL expression. After extraction, we manually filtered the data to exclude false-positive constructions (i.e. constructions that were not *se faire* + infinitive constructions) and those that did not fulfil our predefined criteria for *se faire* passives (see below). The final sample comprised 535 \[count with inline code\] *se faire* passives. We then annotated the lemmas of these constructions and relevant linguistic features, such as verb form, subject animacy and grammatical gender, in order to prepare the data for statistical modelling.

**être passive**

For the être passive constructions, we searched constructions using a CQL expression in SketchEngine. We then filtered the concordances using the list of lemmas we have previously collected from the *se faire* constructions. Due to the download limit of SketchEngine, we downloaded these constructions in four subsamples of 9295-9794 concordances. All filtered instances stored in a .csv file and merged to one dataframe in R. For reproducibility, we set a seed using the function setseed( ) and used this to randomly sample the data. The seed was determined by the lottery numbers on Wednesday, 12^th^ March 2025 as provided on the Website <https://www.lotto.de/lotto-6aus49/lottozahlen>. Using this, we took a random sample from the concordance lines that is equal in size to the manually filtered amount of se faire constructions (i.e. 535 -\> 532 (e**xplain reduction**)). The constructions were then manually annotated for the features listed in sec x.

-   Our final sample therefore comprises XXX sentences/constructions: XX se faire and XX être passive, ... (short summary)

```{=html}
<!--
-   extract être passive constructions with CQL expression
-   In Sketch Engine: Import Word List → lemma list extracted from se faire constructions (for comparability of the constructions, making sure that differences between être and se faire are not due to individual differences of the verb) → Filter out only verb lemmas of se faire from concordance lines → download
-   final sample: same amount of constructions for être and se faire, same lemmas, seed set -->
```

### Manual filtering exclusion criteria/ Borderline Cases

As some linguists (e.g., Martin, Novakova / ... as above?) argue, *se faire* + infinitive can sometimes have a 'passive effect' even without a direct 1:1 alternation with *être*. However, for our study of *se faire* + Infinitive and *être* + past participle as a passive alternation, our main criterion was to include only those constructions that could be paraphrased with the *être* passive. Consequently, we excluded expressions that could not be rephrased with the *être* passive, either because the *être* construction was ungrammatical or the meaning was fundamentally altered.

A typical example of a construcion that met our criterion is:

*Il s’est fait insulter par son collègue.* (“He was insulted by his colleague.”) \[eigenes Beispiel ersetzen\]

*Il a été insulté par son collègue.* (“He was insulted by his colleague.”) \[eigenes Beispiel ersetzen\]

By contrast, expressions such as *se faire connaître* were excluded. For instance:

*Il s’est fait connaître grâce à ses romans.* (“He became known through his novels.”) \[eigenes Beispiel ersetzen\]

is acceptable, but

*\*Il a été connu grâce à ses romans.* \[eigenes Beispiel ersetzen\]

is unusual, as *être connu* does not carry the same meaning.

However, our somewhat "fuzzy" definition of what constitutes a passive alternation [@bohmann_large-scale_2023] posed some challenges: We excluded purely causative constructions, but the distinction between causative and passive was sometimes unclear. When is a construction semantically similar enough, and when is its meaning too causative? As expected, given the extensive debate on PSF's passive status (@sec-debate) and the challenges reported by @bohmann_large-scale_2023 in their investigation of the English *be*/*get* passive alternation, we came across a significant number of "unclear" cases during the manual filtering of *se faire* constructions.

<!-- As described above, the canonical passive with être requires a direct object in the active equivalent which becomes the new subject [@koenig_semantic_1992: 144; @washio_when_1993, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013: 16]. Thus, for reflexive and ditransitive verbs, the être passive is not available and does not compete with se faire. These constructions will be excluded and only transitive verbs will be studied. Similarly, some verb participles and adjectives in French are structurally identical.-->

(This approach is also supported by linguistic analyses that suggest a continuum between causative and passive meanings in *se faire* constructions. that is, *se faire* constructions can switch between passive and causative interpretations depending on the context. The flexibility of this construction suggests that a strict binary classification is inappropriate and reinforces the idea of a causal/passive continuum - at one pole a reduced agentivity of the subject's referent - rather than a rigid distinction. @raineri_analyse_2010 pp. 154ff)

(If the action of the subject is reduced to mere initiation (\[+ déclenchement\]), the se faire construction can be completely paraphrased with an être passive without changing the content of the sentence. For example, *Il se fait remarquer par une patrouille de police* (“He is noticed by a police patrol”) and Il est remarqué par une patrouille de police (“He is noticed by a police patrol”) show an extensive equivalence between se faire and être. Similarly, the other elements in the co-text of *élire* examples weakens the causative strength and strengthens the passive effect. -\> agentivité **variable** / passive-causative continuum with *élire* depending on context @raineri_analyse_2010 p. 160)

We have found many examples of se faire constructions cases where a clear binary distinction between passive and causative was not possible, for example because when the subject is both the undergoer and the causer of the action.

In general, we opted for a broad approach, including as many constructions as possible. This means that even when the causative reading is more natural (because the subject triggers the event), we included the construction as long as a passive understanding was also plausible (since the subject is also undergoing an action). In doing so, we deviate from the first criterion established by @bellec_construction_2014. Examples of such constructions include *se faire vacciner* "to (go) be/get vaccinated" and *se faire élire* "to be/get elected" or "to stand for election".

Some verbs can have a passive and a causative meaning, depending on the context. For example, *se faire remarquer* can mean both "to get noticed" and "to draw attention to oneself". To ensure consistency and practicality, we decided to include or exclude verbs on the basis of their lemma, rather than on individual occurrences. Below, we outline below some high-frequency ambiguous cases and provide our reasoning for the decidions to include or exclude them.

We excluded:

-   Fixed idiomatic expressions with a figurative meaning: "se faire passer pour" *to impersonate sb.*, "se faire avoir" *to be fooled*, "se faire mousser" *to boast/ to brag, "se faire taper sur les doigts" lit. to get a slap on the fingers, to be scolded* ; example: "Dites donc, vous savez vous faire mousser!" *My, you know how to make a fuss!/ You know how to blow your own trumpet!*

    -   \+ *se faire **rouler** dans la farine + se faire **mener** par le bout du nez*

-   Expressions that cannot be converted into a correct active sentence (i.e., the direct object of the active sentence is not the subject of the passive sentence). (ditransitive, intransitive verbs ?), example: "mais se faire expliquer des elements de justice n'est pas la même chose que d'acheter en ligne des produits bio ou une paire de chaussures." *but getting an explanation of legal matters is not the same as buying organic products or a pair of shoes online*

-   Expressions containing verbs classified as "idiomes lexicalisés" (lexicalised idioms) according to Raineri (2010: 163). These verbs neither carry a true causative nor passive meaning [^4]: entendre, sentir, attendre, désirer (Raineri 2010: 164); example: "Partout le mécontentement populaire se faire entendre sans qu'' on ait besoin de souffler sur les braises." *Everywhere, popular discontent is making itself heard without the need to fan the flames.*

-   (Expressions with a transparent causative meaning - maybe not necessary if covered by the other criteria)

-   (Expressions where an être passive has a very different meaning)

-   impersonal être passive constructions (passif impersonnel)

[^4]: These verbs mainly occur with inanimate subjects (effects, consequences, discontent). @raineri_analyse_2010 [163-164] proposes that the causative meaning is not available for these verbs since the subject is not causing the event. There is also no passive meaning since they cannot cannot occur with a complément d’agent and do not have a paraphrase with être.

<!-- ### Annotation Guidelines

**Gender (masculin/ feminin/ mixed/ unknown)**

-   Assign masculin or féminin if the gender is clearly marked grammatically:

    -   Through a pronoun (il(s), elle(s))

    -   Through an adjective or participle that marks gender (heureux/heureuse, content/contente)

-   Use mixed only if:

    -   The context clearly refers to a mixed-gender group (un groupe d’hommes et de femmes)

    -   The grammatical form is not gendered, but the semantic context indicates mixed gender (nous referring explicitly to men and women)

-   Assign unknown if:

    -   No grammatical gender marking is present

    -   For on, vous, je, and nous (if no grammatical marking appears)

    -   For expletive subjects (il faut)

**Progressivity (progressive/ non-progressive)**

-   Assign "progressive" if:

    -   The "se faire" construction is directly in the imparfait or future (except for futur antérieur) → indicates an ongoing or habitual action

    -   The "se faire" construction is linked to an ongoing action, indicated by: A participe présent → Example: Ils acceptent de se faire endoctriner. → progressive/ gerondif + participe présent (en courant - while running)

    -   periphrases e.g., être en train de (present continuous), aller + inf (futur proche), continuer à + Infinitif

    -   adverbs/ Adverbial Phrases Indicating Ongoing Action: Temporal adverbs that imply duration or repetition: En ce moment (at the moment), Actuellement (currently), Toujours (always), Depuis (since), Encore (still)

-   Assign "non-progressive" if:

    -   passé composé, plus-que-parfait, présent, futur antérieur (...) - progressiveness is hinted at by another verb in the sentence (e.g., falloir or être) and not from the "se faire" construction itself
-->
```

### Inter-rater agreement

As [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} data were collected separately, some steps were necessary before conducting analyses on the data. First, the data was cleaned by aligning the speaker and reference columns. Since annotator A annotated all complément d' agents of [se faire]{.smallcaps} during inital filtering, the column `agent_pp` was renamed to `agent_pp_A`. The datasets were then combined, variables were converted from characters to factors and empty values were replaced with `NA` to ensure proper handling of missing values in statistical analysis.

```{r read-annotated-data, include = FALSE}
sefaire_sample_annotated <- read.csv(file = here("data", "sefaire_sample_annotated.csv"))
etre_sample_annotated <- read.csv(file = here("data", "etre_sample_annotated.csv"))
```

```{r data-cleaning-colnames, include = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
# data preprocessing
colnames(etre_sample_annotated)
colnames(sefaire_sample_annotated)

# Differences between the two datasets mainly regard columns speaker and reference: se faire sample has a "speaker" column which includes the speaker id and the name and a "reference" column that includes the speaker ID and the date; être sample has only a "reference" column that includes speaker ID, date, name
```

```{r data-cleaning-colnames-2, echo = TRUE}

  select(reference, speaker, everything())

#still some differences left: être has an "ID" column which se faire does not; être has two agent_pp columns because it was annotated by A and B while se faire only has one, since agent_pp of se faire constructions was annotated there one person (annotator A)

Since the analysis required detailed (and time consuming) manual annotation, we decided to split the annotation work between us. However, to ensure consistent annotation, a representative sample of one third of all instances (320; 33,25%) were double annotated, i.e. by both of us. For these instances, we calculated Cohen's ϰ (Kappa) as a measure of inter-rater agreement, following Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 201] and the documentation in the psy package documentation (<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psy/psy.pdf>).)

We classified the ϰ-values using the influential benchmark categorisation of Landis and Koch [-@landis1977measurement: 165], who define an agreement of 0.81 - 1.00 as "Almost Perfect". Mean inter-rater agreement was high at 0.84. Agreement was lowest for the cateogories Adversativity (0.67) and TAM (0.77).

### Data preprocessing {#sec-data-preprocessing}

For the main analysis, the combined data of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} data were merged into one "clean" dataset where each column corresponds to one factor. This column includes the annotation of the first annotator (annotator A for half of the observations, annotator B for the other half).

```{r merge-to-main-dataset}
#| code-fold: true
#goal: one dataset with one column for each factor, the column includes the annotation of the "main" annotator
# special case agent pp column: if passive variant is se faire -> take value from column "agent pp_A", if passive variant is être is: same procedure as with the other variables
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_combined |> 
  mutate(
    subj_animacy = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ subj_animacy_A,
                             annotator == "B" ~ subj_animacy_B),
    subj_gender = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ subj_gender_A,
                            annotator == "B" ~subj_gender_B),
    agent_pp = case_when(passive_variant == "se faire" ~ agent_pp_A,
                         passive_variant == "être" ~ case_when(
                           annotator == "A" ~ agent_pp_A,
                           annotator == "B" ~ agent_pp_B)),
    modal = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ modal_A,
                      annotator == "B" ~ modal_B),
    tam = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ tam_A, 
                    annotator == "B" ~ tam_B),
    cluster = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ cluster_A, 
                        annotator == "B" ~ cluster_B),
    adversativity = case_when(annotator == "A" ~ adversativity_A, 
                               annotator == "B" ~ adversativity_B)
  )

# remove now-redundant A and B columns, remove ID (irrelevant since it's only there for être)
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean |> 
  select(-subj_animacy_A, -subj_animacy_B, -subj_gender_A, -subj_gender_B, -agent_pp_A, -agent_pp_B, -modal_A, -modal_B, -tam_A, -tam_B, -cluster_A, -cluster_B, -adversativity_A, -adversativity_B, -ID)
```

The sample comprised 1064 observations: 532 for [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} each. Taking a look at the distribution among the categories to identify scarce combinations and patterns that could be problematic for analysis: <!-- create nicer looking table -->

```{r first-look-main-data, echo = FALSE}
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_gender)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$agent_pp)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$modal)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$tam)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$cluster)
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$adversativity)
```

Some patterns are observed in the distribution of constructions: We see that the `subj_animacy` level "inanimate" has comparatively few occurences with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. The level "mixed" of `subject gender` appears infrequently overall and is excluded to prevent skewing of the analysis. The Complément d'agent "de" also is quite infrequent with [se faire]{.smallcaps} but is kept for now (may be excluded later if shown to negatively impact the analysis)

The level "unknown" appears much more often with [se faire]{.smallcaps} than with [être]{.smallcaps}, potentially revealing an annotation-related effect: When annotating gender, we took grammatical gender marking into account. Since [être]{.smallcaps} is realized with a participle that always agrees in gender with the subject, gender was always identifiable and only impersonal constructions were annotated as "unknown". In contrast, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is very common with infinitive constructions, which do not indicate gender. Therefore, when gender was not apparent from the context, it was assigned the label "unknown". We suspect that this creates an artifact because "unknown" is strongly correlated with infinitive constructions, and therefore with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. To test this, we create two separate data frames, one including unknown and one excluding unknown, which will be compared in the analysis. The data without "unknown" includes 503 [être]{.smallcaps} and 367 [se faire]{.smallcaps} constructions.

```{r cleaning-main-data, include=FALSE}
# exclude "mixed" gender because of low frequency (would likely skew the data)
#sample with "unknown" kept
passive_sample_unknown <- passive_sample_clean|>
  filter(subj_gender != "mixed") |>
  droplevels()

# exclude "unknown" gender (needs to be reasoned and explained!)
# (merge "de" and "par" into a "present category")
passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean|> 
  filter(subj_gender != "mixed") |> 
  filter(subj_gender != "unknown") |>
  droplevels()

# passive_sample_clean <- passive_sample_clean |> 
#   mutate(agent_pp = case_when( #to merge par and de
#     agent_pp %in% c("par", "de") ~ "present",
#     TRUE ~ agent_pp
#   )) |> 
#   mutate(agent_pp = factor(agent_pp))

#check levels
levels(passive_sample_clean$subj_gender)
levels(passive_sample_unknown$subj_gender)

#check passive distribution without unknown
table(passive_sample_clean$passive_variant)

```

## Binomial logistic regression

In addition to conducting a descriptive analysis of the data, we employed a binomial logistic regression model to test our hypotheses. This method provides a logit value for each variable that "represents the chances of construction A to be chosen in a particular type of context compared with the chances of construction B to be used in the same type of context" [@levshina_how_2015: 253]. The model allowed us to exactly track the influence of factors and their interactions on the chances of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used over [être]{.smallcaps}.

### Levels {#sec-levels}

The levels are ordered alphabetically by default. We rearranged the reference levels to be most useful for both modelling and interpreting: Where possible, we chose the most standard case as a reference level (passive variant: être, complément d'agent: 0, modal: no, TAM: non-progressive, cluster: neutral). If this would negatively affect the stability of the model, the most frequent (subject animacy: animate, subject gender: masculine) or the most evenly distributed case (adversativity: adversative) was selected.

### Model selection

We fit a mixed-effects binomial logistic regression model in `R` following Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 253-276] and Gries [-@gries_statistics_2021: 393-452]. The model estimates the log of the odds that a given construction is realized with [se faire]{.smallcaps}. To account for individual variation, we include the verb `lemma` and the `speaker` (as indicated in the meta data of ParlaMint 2.1) as random effects.

We set a significance threshold p-value of 0.05 and apply backward stepwise selection [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Model quality was monitored and compared using the Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC), with preference given to the model with the lower AIC value [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Non-significant factors were removed one-by-one, starting with the one with the highest non-significant p-value [@gries_statistics_2021: 366]. Additionally, we evaluated model fit using R^2^, aiming to find the model with the highest possible value and therefore explains most of the variance. Note, however, that Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015] raises concern about the meaningfulness of R^2^ in logistic regression.

::: panel-tabset
#### Maximal Model

First, we construct a model that included all the factors described in @sec-levels, the interactions we hypothesise to be significant, and the random effects of speaker and lemma. While the model does not include all theoretically possible interactions, it is considered maximal in the sense that it encompasses all factors and interactions identified in the literature review as potentially meaningful and contributing to passive choice.

$$
\begin{align*}
passiveVariant & \sim subjAnimacy + subjGender + agentPP + modal + tam + cluster \: + \\ & \qquad adversativity + subjAnimacy:gender + subjAnimacy:cluster \: + \\ & \qquad subjAnimacy:adversativity + cluster:adversativity \: + \\ 
& \qquad (1|lemma) + (1|speaker)
\end{align*}
$$

Although the main effect of `subj_gender` cannot be interpeted due to its participation in an interaction, it is striking that the odds ratio of `subject gender[unknown]` is very high with a huge confidence interval of 10.49 – 124.99. The AIC is 771.3 with an R^2^ of 0.599 when excluding random effects and 0.748 when accounting for them. The vif-analysis reveals no high collinearity values for `subject gender` or the interaction `subject animacy:subject gender`. However, as explained in @sec-data-preprocessing, we suspect an annotated-related artifact related to "unknown". We decide to compare the model to one fitted on the data set that excludes "unknown" constructions.

```{r max-model-unknown, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
final_model_unknown <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:subj_gender + subj_animacy:cluster + subj_animacy:adversativity + cluster:adversativity) + (1|speaker) + (1 | lemma),
    family = "binomial", 
    data = passive_sample_unknown,
    control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
  )

summary(final_model_unknown) # AIC: 759.3
```

```{r max-model-unknown-tab, echo = FALSE}
tab_model(final_model_unknown, show.aic = TRUE) # Marginal R2 / Conditional R2	0.701 / NA
vif(final_model_unknown)
```

#### Model without "unknown"

After excluding "unknown", the model immediately looks more stable. The improvement is reflected in the much smaller AIC of 732.5. The model has an R^2^ of 0.46 / 0.67. Although this is lower than the model without "unknown", and therefore explains less variance, overall, the model seems to make better (i.e. more stable and more precise) predictions. Since the variance explained by the random effects is larger than zero, the random effects must be kept. Due to its better perfomrance, the data without "unknown" are used in future models.

```{r full-passive-glmer, output = FALSE}

#### Model without non-significant interactions

All non-significant interactions (`cluster:adversativity`, `subjAnimacy:cluster`, `subjAnimacy:subjGender`) are removed, improving the AIC to 725.4 with an R^2^ of 0.450 / 0.664. Thus, without the interactions, model accuracy increases while the explained variance decreases slightly. With $p$-values \> 0.05, the categories `subj_gender`, `agent_pp`, `modal` and `tam` are found to be non-significant.

```{r model-back-1, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
model_back_1 <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + agent_pp + modal + tam + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:adversativity) + (1 | lemma) + (1 | speaker),
    family = "binomial",
    data = passive_sample_clean,
    control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
  )

summary(model_back_1) #AIC: 725.4
```

```{r model-back-1-tab, echo = FALSE}
tab_model(model_back_1, show.aic = TRUE)
```

#### Final Model

Non-significant fixed effects are removed step by step, starting with `tam`, which has the highest $p$-value. At each step, the main effect with the highest $p$-value is eliminated. The final model is reported here. Although `subj_gender` remains non-significant ($p$ \> 0.05), we retain it for theoretical and interpretative reasons. The AIC of 719.2 indicates that removing `agent_pp`, `modal` and `tam` improved the model quality while R^2^ stayed constant at 0.451 / 0.662.

```{r final-model, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
final_model <- glmer(
    passive_variant ~ (subj_animacy + subj_gender + cluster + adversativity + subj_animacy:adversativity) + (1 | lemma) + (1 | speaker),

### Residuals and Coefficients

checking residuals (problematic???) https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html (recommended in @gries_statistics_2021 [445])

```{r residuals-diagnostics, include = FALSE}
plot(residuals(final_model) ~ predict(final_model))
#install.packages("DHARMa")
library(DHARMa)
library(arm)
binnedplot(predict(final_model), residuals(final_model))
sim_res <- simulateResiduals(final_model)
plot(sim_res)
testDispersion(sim_res)
```

**Log odds**

Looking at the log odds of the significant variables, it becomes apparent that communication verbs boost the chance of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used, while [être]{.smallcaps} is more likely in non-adversative contexts with inanimate subjects. Although non-significant, feminine subjects favour [se faire]{.smallcaps} over [être]{.smallcaps}.

```{r coefficients-log-odds, echo = FALSE}
final_model_coef <- coefficients(summary(final_model))[,"Estimate"]
final_model_coef
#"a negative coefficient expressed as a logit (or log odds) shows that this outcome is less probably than the reference level"
```

**Odds Ratios**

```{r coefficients-odds, include=FALSE}
#convert from log odds to odds:
exp(final_model_coef)

#convert odds to probabilities
#exp(model_2_coef) / (1 + exp(model_2_coef))
```

The intercept of the final model is 2.78. This means that in the context of the reference levels (subject is animate and masculine, the cluster of the verb is neutral and the construction has an adversative sense), the chances of [se faire]{.smallcpas} being chosen are 2.78 times greater than [être]{.smallcaps}. The exact values of odds ratios are interpreted with regard to our hypothesies in @sec-results-log-effects.

### Concordance Index and Significance

As Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 256] describes, the concordance index measures the ability of the model to discriminate correctly by providing the proportion of times when the model predicts the use of the variant correctly.

```{r concordance-index}
#| code-fold: true
predictions <- predict(final_model, type = "response", na.action = na.omit)
outcome <- as.numeric(na.omit(passive_sample_clean)$passive_variant) - 1

(Hmisc::somers2(predictions, outcome)["C"])
```

The model has a high concordance index of 0.94. According this to the scale reported in Levshina [-@levshina_how_2015: 259], this indicates "outstanding discrimination".

Additonally, we apply an overall significance test by comparing it to a model without predictors (i.e. null model) using an ANOVA [@gries_statistics_2021: 445-446].

```{r model2-significance, echo = FALSE}
null_model <- glmer(passive_variant ~ 1 + (1 | lemma) + (1 | speaker), data = passive_sample_clean, family = binomial)

anova(final_model, null_model, test="Chisq")
#highly significant!
#relative likelihood
(exp((AIC(null_model)-AIC(final_model))/2))

# ### model with unknown
# null_model <- glmer(passive_variant ~ 1 + (1|lemma), data = passive_sample_without_unknown, family = binomial)
# 
# anova(final_model_without_unknown, null_model, test="Chisq")
# #highly significant!!
# #relative likelihood
# (exp((AIC(null_model)-AIC(final_model_without_unknown))/2))
```

The ANOVA shows that our model is highly significant (LR-test=181.02, $p$ \<0.0001), indicating a strong improvement over the null model. The model has a vastly higher relative likelihood compared to the null model.

## Subject responsibility

<!-- We found no significant effect of subject gender, complément d'agent, and modal verbs. The significant main effect of subject animacy cannot be interpreted because it is being distorted by its interaction with adversativity. Interpret subject gender nevertheless as a tendency/ possibility? -->

### Subject Animacy

```{r animacy-descriptive-tables, echo = FALSE}
table(passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy) |> 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) |> 
  proportions ()

#cross-tabulation for hypothesised interactions
tab_animacy <- table(passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy, passive_sample_clean$passive_variant)
tab_animacy

prop.table(tab_animacy, margin = 2) * 100

#proportions (Gries)

#alternatively: (Elen)
#table(passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy) |> 
#  sort(decreasing = TRUE) |> 
#  proportions()
```

Overall, two-thirds of the constructions have animate subjects (mode: animate; 704 vs. 360 inanimate). However, in *être* passives, inanimate subjects are more frequent than animate ones (195 animate, 332 inanimate; about 39% animate, 61% inaniamte), whereas *se faire* passives show a strong preference for animate subjects (341 animate, 26 inanimate - 93% animate, 7% inanimate), as shown in these plots:

qualitative analysis: one example from our corpus of an inaniamte construction?

```{r animacy-descriptive-plots, echo = FALSE}
passive_sample_clean |> 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = subj_animacy)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ passive_variant) +
  #scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
  labs(x = "Subject Animacy",
       y = "Number of observations") +
  theme_bw()

mosaicplot(passive_variant ~ subj_animacy,
           data = passive_sample_clean)
```

The plot shows clearly that in *se faire* passives, the subject is animate in the great majority of cases. In contrast, for *être*, subject animacy is more evenly distributed, with a slight preference for inanimate subjects.

### Subject Gender

Frequencies for Passive Variants Gender and Animacy

ggplot(passive_sample_clean, 
       aes(x = subj_animacy, fill = subj_gender)) +

       fill = "Subject Gender") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FC8D62", "#8DA0CB")) +
  theme_bw()

```

The barplots show that the *être* passive occurs most frequently with inanimate feminine subjects, while the *se faire* passive occurs most frequently with animate masculine subjects. This distribution supports the hypothesis that *se faire* is more frequent with animate male subjects than with animate female subjects.

For both passive variants, animate subjects are predominantly masculine, while inanimate subjects are more frequently feminine. However, the data for *se faire* with inanimate subjects is sparse.

For inanimate subjects, the difference in frequency between masculine and feminine gender is smaller compared to animate subjects, suggesting that the influence of gender on the choice of passive variant could be less strong for inanimate subjects than for animate ones.

## Aspectuality

Surprisingly, and contrary to our hypothesis, the only significant main effect in our model is the verb cluster, with communication verbs favouring *se faire* over *être* passive constructions.

```{r cluster-model-plot, echo = FALSE}

ggpredict(final_model, "cluster") |> 
  plot()

```

@tbl-cluster-lemmas shows that the most frequent lemmas occuring with *se faire* are *insulter* (10 occurences), *engueuler* (7 occurences), and *représenter* (4 occurences). Notably, *insulter* and *engueuler* are both adversive verbs, which may explain their preference for *se faire*.

## Adversativity

Overall, non-adversative constructions occured more frequently than adversative constructions in our data, with a ratio of 69.08% to 30.92%. However, adversative constructions were more common with [se faire]{.smallcaps} than with [être]{.smallcaps}: While only about one fifth (22.66%) of [être]{.smallcaps} were adversative, this was the case for two fifths (42.23%) of [se faire]{.smallcaps}.

```{r adversativity-tab, echo = FALSE}
table(passive_sample_clean$adversativity) |> 
  proportions() * 100

tab_adv<- table(passive_sample_clean$adversativity, passive_sample_clean$passive_variant)

prop.table(tab_adv, margin = 2) * 100
```

```{r adversativity-plot, echo = FALSE}

#   geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
#   facet_wrap(~ passive_variant) +
#   #scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
#   theme_bw() +
#   theme(legend.position = "none") +
#   labs(x = "Subject Animacy",
#        y = "Number of Observations")

mosaicplot(passive_variant ~ adversativity,
           data = passive_sample_clean,
           main = "Ratio of passive variant and adversativity",
           xlab = "adversativity",
           ylab = "passive variant",
           col = c("lightblue", "orange"))
```

Regarding the interaction between subject animacy and adversativity, both adversative and non-adversative constructions with [se faire]{.smallcaps} were used more frequently with animate subjects, while [être]{.smallcaps} constructions were more common with inanimate subjects in non-adversative contexts.

```{r animacy-adversativity-plots, include = FALSE}
#| label: fig-animacy-adversativity
#Interaction Animacy: Adversativity:
ftable(passive_sample_clean$adversativity, passive_sample_clean$passive_variant, passive_sample_clean$subj_animacy)

passive_sample_clean |> 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = subj_animacy, fill = adversativity)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ passive_variant) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
  labs(x = "Subject Animacy",
       y = "Number of Observations", 
       fill = "Adversativity" ) +
  theme_bw()
```

The logistic regression model revealed a significant interaction between subject animacy and adversativity with an odds ratio of 0.06 and a confidence interval of 0.02-0.2. This means that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is 0.06 times as likely as [être]{.smallcaps} when the subject is inanimate and the context is in non-adversative. In other words, in these contexts, [se faire]{.smallcaps} is used significantly less frequently than [être]{.smallcaps}. Conversely, since the categories are binary, this also implies that [se faire]{.smallcaps} is much more common in adversative contexts and with animate subjects than [être]{.smallcaps}.

```{r interaction-model-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: fig-animacy-adversativity-log

ggpredict(final_model, c("subj_animacy", "adversativity")) |> 
  plot() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("lightblue", "orange")) +
  theme_bw()

ggpredict(final_model, c("adversativity", "subj_animacy")) |> 
  plot() +
  theme_bw()
```

As @fig-animacy-adversativity-log illustrates, animate subjects strongly favor [se faire]{.smallcaps} regardless of adversativity, with only a slight additional increase in its likelihood in adversative contexts. In contrast, the likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being used with inanimate subjects increases significantly when the construction has an adversative meaning: [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} are almost equally likely for inanimate subjects in adversative contexts (40% likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps}) whereas in non-adversative contexts, [être]{.smallcaps} is almost exclusively used.

Even though an analysis of the most frequent lemmas shows that [se faire]{.smallcaps} most frequent verbs *insulter* and *engueuler* are adversative, there was no significant interaction effect of adversativity and cluster.

# Discussion

As the multifaceted and partly conflicting literature suggests, the passive is a complex and nuanced phenomenon. This entails some challenges for the systematic study of both passive alternations in general, and of [se faire]{.smallcaps} and [être]{.smallcaps} specifically. Firstly, the variable context is necessarily broad due to [se faire]{.smallcaps}'s similarity to the structurally identical causative construction. As has been shown, several borderline cases can be interpreted as either causative or passive (sometimes even both) depending on the specific context. Similarly, [être]{.smallcaps} constructions range between the stative passive and the progressive passive, with the former sometimes being indistingushable from adjectival constructions. Decisions had to be made regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria; however, a different set of choices could have been equally justified and might have yielded different results. It could be valuable to examine the cases we excluded from our analysis to understand how they differ from genuine passive constructions. This would provide insight into the gray area where passive nuances are present, but no true alternation occurs, allowing for a closer examination of varying degrees of passivity.

With regard to our hypotheses, although few significant effects were found, the strong interaction of subject animacy and adversativity clearly shows that [se faire]{.smallcaps} predominently occurs with animate subjects and in adversative contexts. Subject animacy seems to be the main mediating factor: [se faire]{.smallcaps} is very likely for animate subjects in both adversative and non-adversative contexts while its likelihood decreases significantly for inanimate subjects. This is in line with the vast previous evidence on [se faire]{.smallcaps}'s preference for animate subjects [@koenig_semantic_1992; @novakova_construction_2009; @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967; @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987; @raineri_analyse_2010: 92]. However, our analysis challenge the claim by @tasmowski-de_ryck_causatif_1987 and @spang-hanssen_quelques_1967 that [se faire]{.smallcaps} strictly requires an animate subject: Our data provide evidence of inanimate subjects occuring with [se faire]{.smallcaps} (7%). Consequently, our model predicts that while [se faire]{.smallcaps} has a high chance (55% to 85%) to occur with animate subjects, it may also be found with inanimate subjects, particularly in adversative contexts.

However, as @kupferman_construction_1995 argues, even a strong correlation of subject animacy, adversativity and [se faire]{.smallcaps} does not necessarily imply that the subject is responsible for the event and brings negative consequences upon themselves. Instead, the increased likelihood of [se faire]{.smallcaps} with inanimate subjects in adversative contexts compared to non-adversative contexts suggests that the construction emphasises subject affectedness more than [être]{.smallcaps}. [Note, however, that inter-rater agreement was lowest for adversativity, suggesting some ambiguity regarding this factor, although it was still considered 'substantial']. Overall, we consider these findings to support the theory of [se faire]{.smallcaps} being preferred over canoncial [être]{.smallcaps} when marking subject affectedness.

The remaining factors used to test subject responsibility (subject gender, complement d'agent, modal) did not yield significant effects. This may be taken as further indication for... / this may further strenghthen an argument against subject responsibility and toward subject affectness// The absence of additional significant effects related to subject responsibility may further support this notion.


-   problematic category gender/ unknown; no real effect of gender - maybe tendency?

   -   no effects of modal: summarising tense aspect and mood in a tam category of "progressivity" with strict classification of tenses (although sometimes not fitting in context) potentially problematic (but also needed to ensure inter-rater agreement and limited by the fact that neither of the authors is a native speaker of French) - overall labeling maybe not nuanced enough?
    The "modal" category in our study only includes modal verbs. Other similar constructions that express subject responsibility, such as *avoir besoin de*, *arriver à*, *réussir à*, *envier de*, *avoir des difficultés pour*, *avoir la possibilité de*, and *avoir envie de*, etc. could also be interesting to examine in future research.

-   regarding aspectuality

    -   cluster effect: communication with [se faire]{.smallcaps}; (also preferred with hitting-touching verbs but non-signficant)

    -   random effect of lemma accounts for a lot of the variance - agrees with Bohmann [-@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 48] who reports evidence that the English \[get\] passive, which has been shown to be similar to [se faire]{.smallcaps} in several regards, "is largely lexically conditioned"

One limitation of our study is that the predictions of our model do not directly reflect real-life language use, as [être]{.smallcaps} is far more common than [se faire]{.smallcaps}, which is comparatively rare (ratio in ParlaMint: 324,836 (38.300) être: 1,254 se faire). We created a balanced data set based on [se faire]{.smallcaps} lemmas to prevent our model from being dominated by frequency effects produced by extreme data unbalance.[^5] This approach allowed us to investigate the factors influencing passive choice and their complex interplay. However, it must be kept in mind that this ratio is artificial does not reflect the reality of passive use, in which [être]{.smallcaps} is chosen as the default in most contexts, and [se faire]{.smallcaps} remains a marked exception. 

[^5]: Note that the ratio ended up not being exactly 50:50 because we had to exclude the gender "unknown" which removed 165 se faire and only 29 être constructions. However, this is is still much more balanced than the actual ratio.

A limitation of our study is that the lemmas were determined based on those occurring in *se faire* constructions, which may have influenced the analysis.

"Both the potential insights and the problems entailed by this approach are considerable." [@bohmann_large-scale_2023: 49]

-   interaction animacy x gender: *personne* (feminine) occurs frequently in the sample

(Telicity seems to be another important distinction: According to @bellec_construction_2014 \[209\], the *être* passive is likely to describe a result or mark an endpoint of an action, while the *se faire* passive is used for actions in progress and verbs that are in their nature ongoing (e.g. perception verbs, @bellec_construction_2014 [209]). This could be reflected in the telicity of the verb, with telic verbs preferring the *être* passive and atelic verbs favouring the *se faire* passive.)

-   implications for causativity debate?

# Conclusion/Outlook

-   Future studies: modality (spoken/written) as a factor (compare modalities), analyses on other modalities/varieties/registers

-   se faire passive more likely in informal settings, être passive more likely in formal settings

-   definiteness & pronominality of the subject

-   memory-based learning
