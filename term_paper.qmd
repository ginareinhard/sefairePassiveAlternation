# Introduction

# The French passive alternation of *être* and *se faire*

## The canonical passive with *être*

## The *se faire* passive

### Historical background

-   “modern” construction that has become more and more popular: origin in middle of 20th centruy
-   grammaticalisation process and reanalysis → no transparent lexical meaning anymore; faire becomes auxiliary, se loses reflexive meaning → in merging they lose their reflexive and causative meaning and gain a passive reading (désémantisation)
-   but causative construction did not disappear → coexists with passive reading
-   causative vs. passive reading of the “se faire” construction
-   criteria for causative reading (Lebellec)
-   but: amibiguity possible
-   Washio 1993
-   how much is it used today (according to authors/ background literature) and in which settings
    -   se faire less formal, more figurative and emotional, used to build the passive with indirect object as the agent & to express passivity in dynamic/ ongoing processes, more spoken
    -   etre pasive more “neutral”, more formal, more written

### Structure and meaning

-   “se” as reflexive pronoun, “faire” as causative verb → passive auxiliary (Labelle) → Language example
-   strategy of passivization: binding by a reflexive clitic
-   syntactic characteristics of se faire passive: (Labelle)
    1.  The subject of the higher verb *faire* is interpreted as affected by the lower event as a result of (53).
    2.  There is a missing NP within the embedded VP.
    3.  The reflexive clitic on *faire* binds the missing NP and is coindexed with the subject of *faire*.

## *être* vs. *se faire*: Competition or complementation?
- se faire does not always compete with canonical passive, only if missing NP is a direct object (Washio 1995, Labelle 16) → indirect object of the active sentence can only be used as the agent in se faire construction (no competition with etre → exclude)
- defining the variable context
### Maybe: Comparison to similar alternations in other languages; English, East Asian languages
