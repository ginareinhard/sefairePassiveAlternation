# Introduction

# The French passive alternation of *être* and *se faire*

## Canonical passive with *être*

## *se faire* passive

### Historical background

-   “modern” construction that has become more and more popular: origin in middle of 20th century @bellec_grammaticalisation_2015, @bellec_quand_2014
-   grammaticalisation process and reanalysis → no transparent lexical meaning anymore; faire becomes auxiliary, se loses reflexive meaning → in merging they lose their reflexive and causative meaning and gain a passive reading (désémantisation, @bellec_construction_2014
-   but causative construction did not disappear → coexists with passive reading
-   causative vs. passive reading of the “se faire” construction @kupferman_construction_1995, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 opposing Tasmowski and van Oelen (1987); claimed that passive se faire is only a "weak reading" of the causative and/or that passive reading is not necessary since all constructions can be explained by causative reading @sveberg_se_2012
-   criteria for causative reading @labelle_anticausativizing_2013
-   but: amibiguity possible @washio_when_1993
-   how much is it used today (according to authors/ background literature) and in which settings
    -   se faire less formal, more figurative and emotional, used to build the passive with indirect object as the agent & to express passivity in dynamic/ ongoing processes, more spoken
    -   etre passive more “neutral”, more formal, more written

### Structure and meaning

-   “se” as reflexive pronoun, “faire” as causative verb → passive auxiliary (@labelle_anticausativizing_2013) → Language example
-   strategy of passivization: binding by a reflexive clitic @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 [23]
-   syntactic characteristics of se faire passive: @labelle_anticausativizing_2013
    1.  The subject of the higher verb *faire* is interpreted as affected by the lower event as a result of (53).
    2.  There is a missing NP within the embedded VP.
    3.  The reflexive clitic on *faire* binds the missing NP and is coindexed with the subject of *faire*.

## *être* vs. *se faire*: Competition or complementation?

-   se faire does not always compete with canonical passive, only if missing NP is a direct object, (Washio 1995, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 [16]) → indirect object of the active sentence can only be used as the agent in se faire construction (i.e. no competition with être passive for ditransitive and reflexive verbs → exclude)
-   se faire passive has evolved to be used in sitations without a causer (passive reading) @bellec_construction_2014
-   figurative, "besoin d’expressivité and extravagance" instead of "used up" canonical passive @bellec_construction_2014 [206]
-   defining the variable context!!!
-   while some scholars speak of semantic differences between the canonical passive and the se faire passive, @kupferman_construction_1995 sees them as semnatically synonymous

### Maybe: Comparison to similar alternations in other languages

-   English @bohmann_large-scale_2023, East Asian languages @washio_when_1993 and @guan_multifactorial_2024 , Swedish @cuypere_corpus-based_2014

# Data and Methods

## Data Collection

## Logistic Regression

Variables, Hypotheses, Preference constraints?

### Subject responsibility/ subject affectedness

-   animacy
    -   tagging: continuum? inanimate vs. animate? (@bohmann_large-scale_2023 added: ”body parts”, “other”; @hundt_be-_2024 added: “human”)
    -   get passive: preponderence for animate subjects (@hundt_be-_2024), parallel for French
    -   Gaatone and Tasmowski & Van Oelen: subject of se faire passive always causer; always responsible to some degree for the event; se faire passive strongly disfavours inanimate subjects; however @labelle_anticausativizing_2013 claims that there is no causer in passive se faire → subject is not necessarily responsible (also @washio_when_1993)
    -   se faire passive used to be seen as a subtype of causative se faire construction but @bellec_construction_2014 [212-213] argues against that
    -   affectedness (often negative), more common with animate subjects since inanimate subjects are seldom affected
    -   but: se faire passive also found as used with inanimate subjects (sometimes in idioms, @labelle_anticausativizing_2013)
    -   @bohmann_large-scale_2023: get passive becomes more likely with inanimate subjects over time; development towards a more general passive (43); significance of subject responsibility lessening
-   Agent PP (par-phrase)
    -   Hundt et al: “by-phrase openly assigns responsibility” to an external agent
    -   @bohmann_large-scale_2023: “partially mitigate subject responsibility”, expected to favour be-passive (finding: more in the early data than now)
    -   → par-phrase less likely for se faire than for etre passive?
    -   @kupferman_construction_1995: agentivity requirement for agents denoted by par-phrase
-   Verbs that denote responsibility (which would those be?)

**Hypothesis:**

Se faire is frequently used with subjects that are affected by an action (positively or negatively, emotionally or physically). Since animate subjects are more likely to experience affectedness than inanimate subjects we hypothesize that animate subjects will favour the *se faire* passive, while inanimate subjects will favour the canonical *être* passive.

Further, we hypothesize that the presence of an agent PP (”par”-phrase) prefers the canonical être passive over the se faire passive (because it assigns responsibility to an external agent that is not the subject).

### Aspectuality (Aspect/"Aktionsart")

-   verb telicity: être passive describes a result/ and endpoint (telic) while se faire passive is used for actions that are ongoing/ in process (atelic) @bellec_construction_2014
-   se faire passive preferred for verbs that are in their nature ongoing (e.g. perception verbs) @bellec_construction_2014 [209]
-   periphrase constructions: "être en train de...", "venir de faire qc" (progressive) more natural with se faire passive than with être passive @bellec_construction_2014; être passive more stative and se faire passive more dynamic, inchoative Spang-Hannsen (1967:141), Novakava (2008:7) in @bellec_construction_2014; @keenan_passive_2007 [341]
-   tense: se faire passive used more often with future actions because it emphasizes start and process of an action, être passive more acceptable in passé composé than in imparfait and present; passé composé also used with se faire if speaker wants to emphasize a process @bellec_construction_2014 [210]

### Modality

spoken vs. written

### (Maybe: Register)

Text genre, formal vs. informal

### Adversativity/ Non-neutrality @bohmann_large-scale_2023 [43]

sentiment scores, Verb clusters, verb semantics

### Morphosyntactic features

Negation, subject person, subject number
